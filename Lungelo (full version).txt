100% of households pay VAT. As long as you're a consumer... And not buying exempt or zero-rated supplies.... You will end up paying VAT at the tillbas part of the SP...

2018/04/24, 13:03 - Sechaba: Thank you:)
2018/04/25, 14:23 - Sechaba: Is this why you always saying you don't have money?
2018/04/25, 14:30 - Lungelo: 👀🤷🏾‍♂

2018/04/30, 11:36 - Lungelo: Lol don't send all 500 million of them please. My data 💔 you can send 5 a day. The rest I'll look at when you come back
2018/04/30, 11:37 - Lungelo: Very pretty. From up top it looks like South Africa.
2018/04/30, 11:39 - Lungelo: You should have purchased some African goodies this side and sold it to the people in Switzerland 😭😭😭 didn't think about this. Then you would makr money in FC and ball in S.A.
2018/04/30, 11:40 - Lungelo: Total show-offs with the trophy. Had to put it at the airport for the whole world to see 😒
2018/04/30, 17:08 - Sechaba: That's what I was thinking about in the way here. So many regrets😔
2018/04/30, 19:07 - Lungelo: We slept
2018/04/30, 19:08 - Lungelo: How's the accommodation and stuff there?
2018/04/30, 19:11 - Sechaba: Quite chilled. Airbnb kinda vibe.
2018/04/30, 19:12 - Lungelo: And language barriers?
2018/04/30, 19:15 - Sechaba: Oh that's not a problem. Most of them speak German.
2018/04/30, 19:13 - Lungelo: That's nice. I actually prefer that because you get to know the place intimately.
2018/04/30, 19:13 - Lungelo: Where are you getting WiFi from though 👀
2018/04/30, 22:35 - Sechaba: From my hosts:)
2018/04/30, 22:54 - Lungelo: And you can speak German???
2018/04/30, 22:54 - Lungelo: When does the conference start?
2018/04/30, 22:54 - Lungelo: Any expectations?
2018/04/30, 23:03 - Sechaba: I'm happy with my progress.
2018/04/30, 23:03 - Sechaba: Wednesday.
2018/04/30, 23:05 - Sechaba: Good food, good company, good conversation.
2018/04/30, 23:06 - Lungelo: Good luck and enjoy! 😁
2018/04/30, 23:15 - Sechaba: Thank you🙌🏽
2018/04/30, 23:32 - Lungelo: Ibrahim was looking for you earlier. I told him you are away
2018/05/01, 07:57 - Sechaba: Haha that's true.
2018/05/01, 20:15 - Lungelo: Apparently your biography needs this and not Switzerland 🤷🏾‍♂
2018/05/01, 20:16 - Sechaba: The left half has been cut off.

2018/05/01, 20:17 - Sechaba: Haha that's funny🙈🙈
2018/05/02, 07:47 - Sechaba: Yesterday we got the opportunity to explore the town of St. Gallen a little more. We started the morning off with a tour through a chocolate factory followed by a gondola trip up to the peak of mount Santis. At this point, we were supposed to get a view of the surrounding countries but the fog did not allow us. This trip was then followed by a walk through the town. Here we visited the three Lakes, the cathedral, the library and later concluded the day with a team dinner before the start of the official program today. From here onwards, we will most likely have little opportunity for pictures and sightseeing but I will do my best. In the meantime, I'll send through some of the pics from yesterday.

2018/05/02, 12:29 - Lungelo: Did you at least get to eat some of the chocolate 😩
2018/05/02, 12:31 - Lungelo: Argh shame man. Hope the conference itself is awesome. And that you network like there is no tomorrow
2018/05/02, 12:31 - Lungelo: Sorry for replying now, I had class the whole day 🙈
2018/05/02, 12:33 - Lungelo: Thought it would be summer by now there considering its winter here.
2018/05/02, 16:27 - Sechaba: You really don't have to respond to every single message. The "we" refers to the rest of the participants. Yes, we ate as much as we wanted. And no, summer is being a bit shy at the moment.

2018/05/05, 14:20 - Sechaba: Words fail to describe how incredible this week has been. In a few hours, I will catch my flight back to South Africa. I return with a full heart having met some of the world's brightest minds. I consider it a privilege and an honour to have been here and I truly hope I can visit this wonderful country again in the near future. 

As predicted, the photos did dry up a bit but I have included the few that I did manage to capture.

Thank you for looking out for me this year. Moving to senior res was one of those " leap of faith"/ daunting decisions and I thoroughly enjoyed my time with you at C3 and otherwise. It was so much easier to settle in with your assistance 🙌🏾 Thank you for being genuine, putting in effort when you didn't have to and for staying true to yourself. I will of course miss being your neighbour 😔 (I don't think Jonny and Jan-Louis would appreciate my memes or my devil's advocate tendencies but I hope it works out).

Go out there and change the world. Compliments of the season, sir!🥳🥳🥳
2019/01/01, 20:35 - Sechaba: Ah, this is special. Thank you Lungelo. This message really means so much to me.

http://chng.it/pYQHBVyG
2019/01/18, 10:16 - Lungelo: Nigerian girls are allowed to marry at 11years and through that are being raped. Petition is to raise the age of marriage to 18years

2019/01/18, 11:10 - Lungelo: Lol the issue there is whether sars who know about it. 

If my parents give me money, I'm not declaring that to SARS😂😂😂 they won't know you got money from your parents coz they don't have a right to check your bank account or whatever. And besides, it's probably within the R75k threshold  anyway SARS won't be phased. The problem is when third party declared the income to SARS coz they will get the tax benefit of it... so then SARS knows of it and expects you to then file a return. But practically it's not a big deal if it's not above the threshold...🤷🏾‍♂
2019/01/18, 11:11 - Lungelo: Whether SARS knows about it*
2019/01/18, 11:12 - Lungelo: No I wanna know who sent it🤷🏾‍♂ it's a weird one to explain. But it's obviously blowing a kiss and it's a red heart on it so😅😂😂😂
2019/01/18, 11:13 - Lungelo: As for "I'm doing it for you"😂😂😂
2019/01/18, 11:13 - Lungelo: Must be nice 🙌🏾
2019/01/18, 11:14 - Lungelo: I'm going to see Bishop😂😂😂😂
2019/01/19, 13:43 - Sechaba: Thank you for the help about taxes🙌🏽 And for the emoji thing I guess. Have a nice weekend💃🏽
2019/01/19, 13:44 - Lungelo: What's her name?
2019/01/19, 13:46 - Lungelo: Pleasure. Do get a second opinion though. You know quite a few BAcc people
2019/01/19, 13:46 - Lungelo: Mxm that's from the 1st onwards. No nice weekends here.
2019/01/19, 13:54 - Sechaba: Oh yes shame, almost there☝🏾
2019/01/19, 13:55 - Sechaba: It's really nothing. She doesn't have a name.
2019/01/19, 15:27 - Lungelo: You better start praying in tongues bruh
2019/01/19, 15:28 - Lungelo: That's a lie. You wouldn't have asked about it if you didn't want to interpret it otherwise
2019/01/19, 15:59 - Sechaba: I want you to interpret it without asking for her name.
2019/01/19, 16:07 - Lungelo: I did already so tell me
2019/01/19, 17:11 - Lungelo: Ita going live at 11:30 PM South African time for those who have any to tune in❤😀

2019/01/27, 22:29 - Lungelo: Yessss
2019/01/27, 22:30 - Lungelo: Maybe pop over to visit? Before brexit kicks in?
2019/01/27, 22:34 - Sechaba: Haha it doesn't work like that unfortunately. England visa is a whole other thing🙈
2019/01/27, 22:45 - Lungelo: Devil's work

2019/03/03, 11:59 - Sechaba: What? Where?
2019/03/03, 14:10 - Lungelo: On the blog🙄
2019/03/03, 14:10 - Lungelo: Scroll down
2019/03/03, 21:23 - Sechaba: If wait, I still need to ready more. I read the 'defining moments' one.
2019/03/03, 23:18 - Lungelo: If wait?
2019/03/03, 23:18 - Lungelo: How is the blog so far?
2019/03/03, 23:19 - Sechaba: *oh wait, I still need to read more.
2019/03/03, 23:19 - Lungelo: Apparently I had 1 view from Italy🤔 how far is the Netherlands from Italy? Or are  you in Italy at the moment
2019/03/03, 23:19 - Lungelo: ?
2019/03/03, 23:19 - Lungelo: Okay cool
2019/03/03, 23:21 - Sechaba: A view from Italy?
2019/03/03, 23:21 - Lungelo: You've read  the one about my SLS entry and the other one is about my welcome to the page.

The only one you haven't seen is the campus to corporate part 1
2019/03/03, 23:22 - Lungelo: Yes... that's why I asked how far the 2 countries are from each other
2019/03/03, 23:25 - Sechaba: Non-critical opinion: I love the idea for the blog, and like the blog I read.
2019/03/03, 23:25 - Sechaba: I haven't read your welcome page or your welcome to..
2019/03/03, 23:25 - Lungelo: And critical?
2019/03/03, 23:26 - Sechaba: No, I don't have a view of Italy. I'm in Frankfurt at the moment.
2019/03/03, 23:26 - Lungelo: Nothing special but awe. You can check it out
2019/03/03, 23:26 - Lungelo: Isn't that like the UK?
2019/03/03, 23:27 - Lungelo: Nvm I see you back to your German routes
2019/03/03, 23:27 - Lungelo: Hope Hitler's ghost doesn't bite
2019/03/03, 23:29 - Sechaba: Deep.
2019/03/03, 23:35 - Lungelo: That was a joke 😅😅😅
2019/03/03, 23:36 - Lungelo: This is why I can't be an online content producer. I'll get into shit a lot
2019/03/03, 23:38 - Sechaba: Positives:
Well-written
Good topic choice
Honest

Negatives:
Argumentation + structure could be better

If I'm nitpicking, I would also say we are complicit to climate change.
2019/03/03, 23:42 - Lungelo: It wasn't a topic I was keen on writing about but it was the only suggestion I got (topic credits to Michael)... there's really not much to say about that one 🤷🏾‍♂🤷🏾‍♂🤷🏾‍♂ hence I struggled a bit to gather my thoughts...


Yes, we are complicit, but I thought it would add a bit of humour to a seemingly dry piece.

But thank you for your suggestion. I'll consider it  for future reference.
2019/03/06, 19:55 - Sechaba: This man is the real deal☝🏾
2019/03/06, 21:06 - Lungelo: He's really good
2019/03/06, 21:06 - Lungelo: Spoke very well
2019/03/06, 22:57 - Lungelo: How are you?
2019/03/06, 22:58 - Lungelo: He touched about a lot of things that I was ignorant abour
2019/03/06, 22:58 - Lungelo: About
2019/03/08, 04:20 - Sechaba: Ah, that's so cool. I keep getting invites to events like these that I obviously can't attend🙁
2019/03/08, 04:22 - Sechaba: I'm pretty well. Currently doing a bit of traveling this week. Making a stop Budapest for the weekend now. 

How are you?
2019/03/10, 10:28 - Lungelo: Lol the experience you're enjoying now can't compare
2019/03/10, 10:29 - Lungelo: You're living your best life  "pretty well"

Yaaaas enjoy that! Who you traveling around with?
2019/03/10, 10:29 - Lungelo: I'm good how are you?
2019/03/10, 10:29 - Lungelo: And why were you up at the wee hours of the morning?!
2019/03/17, 00:28 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/03/17, 00:29 - Lungelo: Lol your dp is quite thug like. You'd easily pass for a drug-srlling gangster in the mafia or something. Cool though 👍🏾
2019/03/17, 01:47 - Sechaba: Look at you going international already😎
2019/03/17, 01:48 - Sechaba: Exactly what I was going for, I'm glad you get it. Thank you.
2019/03/17, 09:25 - Lungelo: It's all you
2019/03/17, 09:25 - Lungelo: Lol
2019/03/17, 09:25 - Lungelo: 😂😂😂😂😂 don't get yourself shot though😬
2019/03/17, 14:36 - Lungelo: Check out my latest blog entry
2019/03/17, 14:36 - Lungelo: Yoh! Staying up late 😬
2019/03/17, 15:01 - Sechaba: The Italy one is definitely not me enough.
2019/03/17, 15:02 - Sechaba: Yeah, I'll check out your blog👌🏾
2019/03/17, 15:05 - Lungelo: Lol then who could it be!😅 my blog doesn't even show up in google🤔
2019/03/17, 15:15 - Sechaba: It's clearly one of your other friends.
2019/03/17, 15:23 - Lungelo: 👀
2019/03/17, 15:23 - Lungelo: You're the only international friend I have😂😂😂
2019/03/17, 15:23 - Lungelo: And David
2019/03/17, 15:24 - Lungelo: But he's in London and hasn't read any of my posts 🙄🙄🙄
2019/03/17, 15:31 - Sechaba: But you know can't trust people nowadays. People will just go to Italy on holiday without telling you.
2019/03/17, 15:32 - Lungelo: True story!!!!!!!!
2019/03/17, 15:33 - Lungelo: But I mean, it's not like they'd take me with in the first place so 🤷🏾‍♂ whatever
2019/03/17, 21:15 - Lungelo: And??? Are you going to Switzerland????😬😬😬😬😬😬
2019/03/17, 21:31 - Sechaba: Haha no, I'm not going.
2019/03/17, 21:35 - Sechaba: Have you already decided what your angle for the next part of your recent blog is going to be?
2019/03/17, 22:29 - Lungelo: No.
2019/03/17, 22:31 - Lungelo: I'm still collecting data
2019/03/17, 22:31 - Lungelo: Do you have any suggestions?
2019/03/17, 22:38 - Lungelo: I'm sorry😔😭😭😭
2019/03/17, 23:45 - Sechaba: Thank you. I've made my peace with it after a less than ideal weak wallowing in disappointment.
2019/03/17, 23:45 - Sechaba: *week
2019/03/17, 23:48 - Sechaba: I really like the topic, it's definitely something that many people think and talk about. I was just wondering why you didn't focus on 'black taxes' in this first part. My reasoning...
2019/03/17, 23:58 - Sechaba: 1. People are already familiar with the term and you would be adding to the discussion. I think 'family responsibility tax' is a bit awkward of an awkward term.                                                                                                                                      2. Related to the first point... If you speak about black tax then you can add anecdotes that would make the topic more real and relatable. You could then try to find people of other races to co-author the other parts with you and they could make each part more personal.                                                                                                                                               3. Many of the points you raise are unwittingly specific to black people.                                                                              4. Somewhat related to the third point but family tax is characterised as 'black' because: 1. black people are experiencing the most significant rise in incomes, 2. they remain the poorest race, currently experiencing widening inequality and 3. they are arguably the most attached to the idea of ubuntu -- therefore it makes sense to start with them.
2019/03/23, 03:20 - Sechaba: How are the bike lessons going?

2019/03/23, 14:02 - Lungelo: The last time I saw him was yesterday. And before that it was last year
2019/03/23, 14:05 - Sechaba: Do you even know where you work?
2019/03/23, 14:06 - Lungelo: This negativity

2019/03/23, 19:06 - Sechaba: I was wondering if I could borrow it while you're busy marking.

2019/03/23, 19:20 - Lungelo: Can't there be 2 people logging in at once?
2019/03/23, 19:32 - Sechaba: I wasn't aware you're watching. I don't think you can have more than 1 person though.
2019/03/23, 19:38 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/03/23, 19:43 - Sechaba: Ah that makes sense. Don't worry about it then, I thought this whole thing was simpler.

2019/03/25, 18:41 - Sechaba: Thank you. I see that you can actually registered up to six devices but can only have one streaming at a time.
2019/03/25, 18:42 - Lungelo: Really? I signed up for 2 streaming at a time
2019/03/25, 18:43 - Sechaba: Oh cool. That's the other plan.
2019/03/25, 18:44 - Lungelo: It's R40 extra
2019/03/25, 18:44 - Lungelo: Try logging in. I'm currently on

2019/03/25, 18:58 - Sechaba: Thank you!🙌🏽
2019/03/25, 18:58 - Lungelo: Pleasure and enjoy!
2019/03/25, 18:58 - Sechaba: But if you and your girl need to stream at the same time for whatever reason, don't be afraid to let me know.
2019/03/25, 18:59 - Lungelo: There is no girl in my life man. And of there was, we'd stream together
2019/03/25, 19:02 - Sechaba: 😎

2019/03/29, 21:12 - Sechaba: Ah, please keep me updated🙌🏾
2019/03/29, 21:14 - Lungelo: I asked Christoph but he hasn't replied
2019/03/29, 21:14 - Lungelo: Who do you wanna know about except Ilse and Matthew?
2019/03/29, 21:14 - Sechaba: We've got to assume he is out celebrating.
2019/03/29, 21:14 - Sechaba: Who else is there?
2019/03/29, 21:15 - Lungelo: No, about the others. He replied to my congratulations
2019/03/29, 21:15 - Lungelo: 🤷🏾‍♂
2019/03/29, 21:15 - Lungelo: That's why I'm asking you!
2019/03/29, 21:16 - Sechaba: Ah, I think it's just the two then. Will chat later.

2019/03/29, 21:55 - Lungelo: Alone?
2019/03/29, 21:55 - Lungelo: Fancy shit.
2019/03/29, 21:56 - Sechaba: ✌🏽
2019/03/29, 21:57 - Sechaba: Yeah. The prices are similar to SA but everything is fancier.
2019/03/29, 21:59 - Sechaba: You can play PS4 while you wait😁😁
2019/03/29, 21:59 - Lungelo: Who's the other person?
2019/03/29, 22:00 - Sechaba: It's just me.
2019/03/29, 22:00 - Lungelo: Of course. 1st world problems
2019/03/29, 22:00 - Lungelo: Shame. So sad.
2019/03/29, 22:00 - Sechaba: Movie is starting.
2019/03/29, 22:00 - Lungelo: Lol I not a fan so 🤷🏾‍♂

2019/03/30, 00:29 - Sechaba: 😱😱😱😱
2019/03/30, 00:29 - Sechaba: I'm never inviting you to my bachelor pad.
2019/03/30, 02:07 - Lungelo: Matthew passed👍🏾
2019/03/30, 08:33 - Lungelo: I can't use it
2019/03/30, 08:34 - Lungelo: I had little exposure to that stuff growing up so I've learnt to do without it.
2019/03/30, 08:45 - Sechaba: Fair enough.
2019/03/30, 08:46 - Lungelo: Jumping to such rash conclusions
2019/03/30, 08:47 - Lungelo: I think Ilse and Nhla didn't make it🥺
2019/03/30, 08:47 - Sechaba: 🙁
2019/03/30, 08:47 - Lungelo: Nhla posted a status about minding your own business and Ilse has posted nothing. She normally posts something.
2019/03/30, 08:49 - Sechaba: Ah, that really sucks. Are you going to send them a message?
2019/03/30, 08:50 - Lungelo: No
2019/03/30, 08:50 - Lungelo: Not Ilse anyway
2019/03/30, 08:51 - Lungelo: But Nhla yes. Maybe tomorrow.
2019/03/30, 08:51 - Lungelo: You know only 11 African  people sat for that board exam from Stellies
2019/03/30, 08:51 - Lungelo: 8 passed
2019/03/30, 08:54 - Sechaba: Are you talking about black people?
2019/03/30, 08:54 - Sechaba: How many usually write?
2019/03/30, 08:54 - Lungelo: Yes
2019/03/30, 08:55 - Lungelo: Everyone in total is 249+
There were 280 people that wrote from Stellies.
2019/03/30, 08:58 - Sechaba: But how many black people from Stellies usually write?
2019/03/30, 08:58 - Lungelo: No idea. I didn't look at the previous stats. But how hectic!
2019/03/30, 08:59 - Lungelo: Only 4% of the total
2019/03/30, 09:00 - Sechaba: But I'm still a bit confused. So you definitely had more than 11 black people in your class last year and only 11 decided to show up?
2019/03/30, 09:06 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/03/30, 09:27 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/03/30, 09:42 - Lungelo: I don't know how many African people there were in total last year...

2019/03/30, 14:59 - Sechaba: You do know international shipping is a thing right?

2019/04/10, 23:30 - Lungelo: Sign
2019/04/10, 23:32 - Sechaba: That the Dutch are going to colonize us again?
2019/04/10, 23:37 - Lungelo: Lmao!!!!!!
2019/04/10, 23:37 - Lungelo: That voting brings freedom if done soberly and democratically
2019/04/10, 23:46 - Sechaba: You clearly feel very strongly about this.
2019/04/11, 07:32 - Lungelo: Not really. Just a thought
2019/04/14, 14:34 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo:) What's your size?

2019/05/06, 19:47 - Lungelo: Look at you lying and saying you never got a person when you left Stellies because you don't do long distance relationships. Meanwhile...

There's nothinglike going back to a place that hasn't changed to find ways that you have changed.
2019/06/23, 22:58 - Lungelo: I was going through the most. Like. The most. 

Haibo everyone can speak Zulu in Joburg 🙄🙄🙄

2019/07/01, 19:09 - Lungelo: That wasn't the point of this msg
2019/07/01, 19:10 - Lungelo: Likewise
2019/07/01, 19:23 - Sechaba: What was the point of the message?
2019/07/01, 19:34 - Lungelo: Just to show you that he's in love 🤷🏾‍♂
2019/07/02, 20:42 - Lungelo: In Pretoria we date with a life copy. You walk in with the original ... to last the weekend?🤷🏾‍♂
2019/07/02, 20:42 - Lungelo: What's Rao Boloka
2019/07/02, 20:49 - Sechaba: In Pretoria we date with a photocopy of the heart. If you enter a relationship with the original, you'll be buried on the weekend.

2019/07/02, 20:50 - Lungelo: Really?
2019/07/02, 20:51 - Lungelo: I thought Pretoria=Tswana
2019/07/02, 20:51 - Sechaba: Yeah, mostly Sepedi.
2019/07/02, 20:52 - Sechaba: Very subtle differences. I think it's difficult for non-native speakers to distinguish.
2019/07/02, 20:53 - Sechaba: Sometimes words are the same across the languages but mean different things or are pronounced differently.
2019/07/02, 20:54 - Lungelo: FML 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

2019/07/02, 20:55 - Lungelo: I know this but pelo?
2019/07/02, 20:56 - Sechaba: But also Pretoria people mix a lot - they kinda have their own dialect.

2019/07/02, 21:00 - Lungelo: Figured. Okay sho✌🏾
2019/07/02, 21:00 - Sechaba: I'm just kidding, I didn't know there's anything wrong with them. They're really pretty.
2019/07/02, 21:00 - Lungelo: What's the warning?
2019/07/02, 21:00 - Lungelo: Be honest
2019/07/02, 21:01 - Sechaba: The pic you sent.
2019/07/02, 21:04 - Sechaba: There's a warning about girls from everywhere nowadays anyway.
2019/07/02, 21:05 - Lungelo: That you'll catch aids or something
2019/07/02, 21:05 - Lungelo: Never had a warning about Stellies
2019/07/02, 21:05 - Lungelo: Had warnings about coloured girls and violence
2019/07/02, 21:06 - Sechaba: Ah, don't get me into trouble🙈
2019/07/02, 21:06 - Sechaba: You can at least remove my name in your status😐

2019/07/02, 21:15 - Sechaba: 🙈🙈🙈
2019/07/02, 21:16 - Sechaba: But my advice is being interpreted incorrectly. I was saying stay away primarily because of the language thing.
2019/07/02, 21:17 - Sechaba: I can't confirm or refute the other thing.
2019/07/02, 21:28 - Lungelo: Oh please. When has that been an issue for you? You looove intermixing so
2019/07/02, 21:28 - Lungelo: The lies. I already know
2019/07/02, 21:29 - Sechaba: For you. It's not a problem for me. You kept saying FML.
2019/07/02, 21:30 - Lungelo: FML because I've got a lot to learn
2019/07/02, 21:30 - Lungelo: And it feels like I'm starting over from the bottom all over
2019/07/02, 21:51 - Sechaba: It's not that deep🙈
2019/07/02, 21:59 - Lungelo: For you
2019/07/04, 12:45 - Sechaba: Why is calling someone 'inyoni' an insult?
2019/07/04, 12:45 - Sechaba: Sounds like a compliment to me.
2019/07/04, 12:46 - Lungelo: Lmao inyoni means bird
2019/07/04, 12:46 - Lungelo: Most birds are dom/ stupid. That's why they get killed or eaten.
2019/07/04, 12:46 - Lungelo: To be called inyoni means you're stupid.
2019/07/04, 12:59 - Sechaba: Ah, like a pigeon. I was thinking of Eagles.
2019/07/04, 13:00 - Sechaba: Sizwe Dhlomo -> Vusi Thembakwayo

2019/07/05, 13:24 - Lungelo: No. King IV says that there needs to be a mix of your and old. All races and genders
2019/07/05, 13:25 - Lungelo: Experience sitting on a board does count (which is what old people have) but it's not the be all and end all.
2019/07/05, 16:31 - Sechaba: Oh oh, thank you. I'll think about it. Are you going to apply?
2019/07/05, 16:34 - Lungelo: For shits and giggles yes
2019/07/05, 17:41 - Sechaba: Why aren't you taking it seriously?
2019/07/05, 17:41 - Sechaba: I care about SAICA way less than you do.
2019/07/05, 17:42 - Lungelo: Because the chances of me getting it are ridiculously small.
2019/07/05, 17:42 - Lungelo: There are applicants I know that are waaaaaaaaaaaay qualified within the CA stream
2019/07/05, 17:42 - Lungelo: You could get in as a non exec who's not in the profession
2019/07/05, 17:43 - Sechaba: And you don't know any outside of the CA stream which is why you want me to apply🙈
2019/07/05, 17:43 - Lungelo: It wouldn't look good if they took a 1st year trainee got the job
2019/07/05, 17:43 - Lungelo: That's not why I suggested you do it.
2019/07/05, 17:44 - Lungelo: But if that's what you want to believe then yes.

2019/07/05, 22:38 - Lungelo: 2009👀 why?
2019/07/05, 22:38 - Lungelo: When was the last time you watched it?
2019/07/05, 22:41 - Sechaba: Tonight. I don't remember it being so sad😐
2019/07/05, 22:44 - Lungelo: It's quite deep.
2019/07/05, 22:44 - Lungelo: With the shooting and the stolen baby
2019/07/05, 22:44 - Lungelo: The he fed it condensed milk
2019/07/05, 22:44 - Lungelo: It's quite deep I remember
2019/07/05, 22:45 - Lungelo: The white people gave desensitized you to the realities of SA🤐
2019/07/06, 09:46 - Sechaba: No, it's not that. It's difficult to explain but it's more that I understand better how crime is not always so black and white. There's a person and a story behind every crime and we almost never get to see that.
2019/07/06, 09:48 - Sechaba: At the end of the movie, you sympathise with Tsotsi as you recognise how human he is and how like many of us he is still trying to get his life together.
2019/07/06, 10:11 - Lungelo: True... but that's a handful of thugs
2019/07/06, 10:12 - Lungelo: Behind the story many of them don't have this need to live a normal life.
2019/07/06, 11:34 - Sechaba: There's absolutely no way you could know this for certain.
2019/07/06, 11:43 - Lungelo: I personally know a few thieves
2019/07/06, 11:45 - Lungelo: For them stealing is like sex to most people. Meaningless. If they not stealing they just chilling smoking something... Or celebrating how they nailed a job... life's all good. Not a second thought about bettering themselves or any of that stuff...
2019/07/06, 12:28 - Sechaba: Yeah, me too. It doesn't mean you can speak on behalf of the entire population though.
2019/07/06, 13:26 - Lungelo: I just did 🤭
2019/07/07, 14:18 - Sechaba: What's this Mabena thing?
2019/07/07, 14:19 - Lungelo: Lmao
2019/07/07, 14:19 - Lungelo: I'm going to send a VN
2019/07/07, 14:22 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/07/07, 15:27 - Sechaba: 😂😂😂😂
2019/07/07, 15:52 - Lungelo: Lol why the 😂😂😂😅
2019/07/07, 20:20 - Sechaba: It's funny.
2019/07/09, 16:51 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/07/09, 19:33 - Lungelo: Which trainee told you how much we earn👀👀👀
2019/07/09, 19:34 - Lungelo: Since you know, how much is it?
2019/07/09, 19:41 - Lungelo: I take home just under R20k gross a month and I live okay because I don't have a car. 

SARS, UIF, SDL, those are compulsory.

So my expenses are as follows:

Rent R4325. This depends on location and what you're looking for. For me. Safety, a complex with good amenities/ maintenance were my priority And convenience NB. 

(electricity water  and internet) R700. This is cheap because we share. If you don't share, you'll pay more. R700 for uncapped internet on it's own plus R200 telkom line... unless if you get a deal.

Life insurance with funeral cover R260 

Medical Aid R1400 coz it's under my mom. Discovery can go up to R3k depending on the cover. You're young. Pick one with comprehensive hospital cover and less doctors appointments.

SARS
2019/07/09, 19:43 - Lungelo: Then I had a lot of start up costs that I had to incur.

I had to buy suits R2k at markharms. Can get cheaper at Edgars. Woolies is expensive.
2019/07/09, 19:43 - Lungelo: 2k per suit
2019/07/09, 19:45 - Lungelo: Shirts, pants, jerseys and shoes could cost between R500 to R2k a month... depends on what you buy. I had to start from scratch so most of my pants and shirts are new. And you need to buy lots of basic colours like lots of white shirts, black, navy, powder blue. Them add the pinks, stripes etc
2019/07/09, 19:46 - Lungelo: Savings. This depends on your goals and ambitions. My short term savings were mainly for my move to Joburg so I saved 20% of my salary. 15% in a 32 day account and 5% emergency fund.
2019/07/09, 19:47 - Lungelo: What you need to start doing which I'm not doing yet: saving for retirement.

Saving for travels.

Car insurance: risk dependent: min R1k

Petrol. Depends. From R1k to R3k a month.
2019/07/09, 19:48 - Lungelo: Those are the basics. Then you need to eat. So food I spend R1700 on avg. Maybe less. Incl going out. I don't cook as much because I come home late and I'm normally quite tired so I buy on the go. But healthy on the go if I can.
2019/07/09, 19:49 - Lungelo: Also consider black taxes. You must identify your taxes and deal with them accordingly.
2019/07/09, 19:49 - Lungelo: Then tithes.
2019/07/09, 19:50 - Lungelo: Luxuries: legal cover R150 a month. I don't do this. When I start my businesses I will get it.
2019/07/09, 19:51 - Lungelo: Car maintenance costs like car wash and replacing small things R350- R700
2019/07/09, 19:51 - Lungelo: That's all I can think of at the moment.
2019/07/09, 19:52 - Lungelo: Your biggest costs are the initial investment costs. Like deposits for the flat and furniture. Fridge, microwave, bed, curtains etc
 That shit is expensive. Cutlery crockery glasses
2019/07/09, 19:54 - Lungelo: Utensils.
2019/07/09, 19:55 - Lungelo: And work clothes. Quality clothes are expensive generally...
2019/07/09, 19:55 - Lungelo: Woolies has good shirts and sometimes suits. H&M has good pants... Markham is quite good in general although fit is an issue sometimes.
2019/07/09, 19:56 - Lungelo: I still don't have half the things I need in my closet.  But I'm buying one by one.
2019/07/09, 19:56 - Lungelo: Also car deposit if you're going to get a new car.
2019/07/09, 21:06 - Sechaba: Ok, you were right. At least for the first year. 20k can be really tight.
2019/07/09, 21:06 - Sechaba: Thank you for the list. Comprehensive. Some things to start thinking about.
2019/07/09, 21:08 - Sechaba: + umuntu wakho.
2019/07/09, 21:08 - Lungelo: And you only realise that now.🙄 I'm always right.
2019/07/09, 21:09 - Lungelo: Good luck!
2019/07/09, 21:09 - Lungelo: Lol umuntu wani😉😅😅
2019/07/09, 21:10 - Lungelo: That's not even included in the 20k😒🙈
2019/07/09, 21:11 - Lungelo: It will always be tight. Coz a lot of these expenses are recurring. If you're not replacing a blazer you're replacing a shoe...
2019/07/09, 21:11 - Lungelo: Oh and general clothes as well; when you're not in the suits
2019/07/09, 21:12 - Lungelo: I forgot grooming costs. The perfume, the mouthwash, soaps etc. It's costly AF🙈🙈🙈

Cleaning supplies as well MAIGOT 🙆🏾‍♂🙆🏾‍♂🙆🏾‍♂
2019/07/09, 21:13 - Lungelo: Washing soap alone is R70
2019/07/09, 21:13 - Sechaba: 😭😭😭
2019/07/09, 21:18 - Lungelo: Adulting is tough. You really need to matH
2019/07/09, 21:19 - Lungelo: Manage it wisely
2019/07/09, 21:23 - Sechaba: True.
2019/07/11, 10:28 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/07/11, 12:49 - Sechaba: Thank you!🙌🏽
2019/07/13, 11:18 - Sechaba: Smart consumers don't have credit cards?
2019/07/13, 11:22 - Lungelo: Circumstancial
2019/07/13, 11:23 - Lungelo: Plus you can earn ebucks from credit cards. So if you pay it off it's a double win because you would have earned eBucks and no Interest. Plus discounts on stuff
2019/07/13, 11:23 - Lungelo: But sometimes stuff happens.
2019/07/13, 11:23 - Lungelo: Black taxes... unexpected expenses. Plus they are a lot cheaper than loans and clothing accounts
2019/07/13, 11:36 - Sechaba: If you don't spend money you don't have, you don't pay interest either.
2019/07/13, 11:37 - Lungelo: It's not that simple.
2019/07/13, 11:37 - Sechaba: Loans are for bigger durable items. That's a different story.
2019/07/13, 11:37 - Sechaba: Black taxes is a different issue.
2019/07/13, 11:37 - Lungelo: But awe. To each their own
2019/07/13, 11:38 - Lungelo: You get temporary loans
2019/07/13, 11:38 - Lungelo: It's intertwined because it's a financial issue.
2019/07/13, 11:39 - Sechaba: I don't think so. I mean justifying multiple credit cards is surely untenable.
2019/07/13, 11:39 - Lungelo: I'm not justifying multiple credit cards
2019/07/13, 11:39 - Lungelo: I'm justifying a credit card in general
2019/07/13, 11:40 - Lungelo: 1
2019/07/13, 11:40 - Sechaba: Yeah and I get that. People's situations differ.
2019/07/13, 11:41 - Sechaba: Your post includes multiple credit cards pictured in the pocket.
2019/07/13, 11:46 - Sechaba: Case for credit cards:
1. Helps with consumption smoothing
2. You can set limits and it doesn't always have to get out of control
3. Reduced theft/loss liability
4. Access to a greater range of products/services
2019/07/16, 15:11 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo. Are there IFRS standards that are targeted at banks?
2019/07/16, 15:24 - Lungelo: There are parts of the IFRS that apply to financial services institutions.
2019/07/16, 15:26 - Lungelo: Remember IFRS is a set of rules for how to account for types of things. So for example, if you have a vehicle, it's property plant and equipment IAS16 (a chapter in the IFRS) so you'll apply the chapters that apply to you in that year. If that makes sense.
2019/07/17, 09:28 - Sechaba: Cool. I know IFRS 9 has something for banks. Which other chapters are relevant?
2019/07/17, 09:29 - Lungelo: Lol who told you about IFRS9😂
2019/07/17, 09:32 - Lungelo: IAS 21  foreign operations and foreign transactions
2019/07/17, 09:33 - Lungelo: IFRS 17 Insurance contracts
2019/07/17, 09:33 - Lungelo: All of them actually. There's Not one that deals with banks. Each standard has a part that deals with a scenario a bank might have
2019/07/17, 09:40 - Sechaba: Ah, but the most important ones are those you mentioned?
2019/07/17, 09:40 - Lungelo: I guess...
2019/07/17, 09:40 - Sechaba: People talk.
2019/07/17, 09:41 - Lungelo: IAS32 and IFRS 9 go hand in hand. You start at IAS32 and then IFRS 9
2019/07/17, 09:41 - Sechaba: Cool, thank you🙌🏽
2019/07/17, 09:42 - Lungelo: Why'd you need it
2019/07/17, 09:44 - Sechaba: Interview prep.
2019/07/17, 10:05 - Lungelo: Which company
2019/07/17, 10:15 - Sechaba: Monocle.
2019/07/17, 10:24 - Lungelo: Good luck
2019/07/17, 10:48 - Sechaba: Thank you.
2019/07/17, 22:49 - Lungelo: ???
2019/07/17, 22:52 - Lungelo: Please send that 4minute vn with the questions you've encountered at Interviews

2019/07/20, 12:01 - Lungelo: Have you read it?
2019/07/20, 12:01 - Lungelo: Any thoughts?
2019/07/20, 19:54 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/07/20, 20:02 - Lungelo: Just do it. If you've got more things to say just say them.
2019/07/20, 20:03 - Lungelo: I'll post the link separately on my story. But those that want to read it will make the effort 🤷🏾‍♂
2019/07/20, 20:03 - Lungelo: Give your in-depth analysis
2019/07/20, 20:37 - Sechaba: No, don't think like that.
2019/07/20, 20:37 - Sechaba: Can I give it tomorrow?
2019/07/20, 20:40 - Lungelo: Lol why not😅
2019/07/20, 20:40 - Lungelo: Why not today?
2019/07/20, 20:40 - Sechaba: I'm about to watch a movie☝🏾
2019/07/20, 20:43 - Lungelo: What movie?
2019/07/20, 20:48 - Sechaba: I don't, I'm deciding.
2019/07/21, 13:43 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/07/21, 16:11 - Lungelo: I just updated the post now. A friend sent in more questions.✌🏾
2019/08/02, 20:54 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/08/02, 22:40 - Lungelo: How is there a good chance that you'll be in Hyde Park?
2019/08/02, 22:40 - Lungelo: Lol as for hoping that I'm sitting down😂

I've been told people are dead while crossing the street🤭
2019/08/02, 22:41 - Lungelo: Bruh I'd be keen for that✌🏾
2019/08/02, 22:42 - Lungelo: Personally I'd prefer 2 (so just us) but if push comes to shove awe we could get a 3rd person
2019/08/02, 22:42 - Lungelo: Ashleigh also asked us to keep an eye out for her when we looking
2019/08/02, 22:42 - Lungelo: But she wants Midrand
2019/08/02, 23:51 - Sechaba: I've received an offer for Sandton. Waiting to hear back from Hyde Park.
2019/08/02, 23:52 - Sechaba: Prefer two as well. 3 if push comes to shove.
2019/08/02, 23:52 - Lungelo: I'm aware of that. I meant which company I  Sandton?
2019/08/02, 23:52 - Lungelo: ✌🏾
2019/08/02, 23:53 - Sechaba: Very adamant about being as close as possible to Sandton.
2019/08/02, 23:53 - Sechaba: How are you aware of this?
2019/08/02, 23:53 - Lungelo: You said in your VN that you got an offer in sandton
2019/08/02, 23:54 - Lungelo: But there's a cost vs benefit trade off
2019/08/02, 23:54 - Sechaba: I don't remember saying that🙈
2019/08/02, 23:54 - Lungelo: Re-listen. You'll hear
2019/08/02, 23:54 - Lungelo: I deduced
2019/08/02, 23:55 - Sechaba: Yes but we can still live like 15 mins away and not starve.
2019/08/03, 09:36 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/08/03, 11:10 - Lungelo: No she's not looking to move in with me😂
2019/08/03, 11:10 - Lungelo: She just said she wants a place in Midrand
2019/08/03, 11:10 - Lungelo: She's working there
2019/08/03, 11:10 - Lungelo: You misunderstood
2019/08/03, 11:11 - Lungelo: And must halla if we find nice places
2019/08/03, 11:39 - Sechaba: Oh, ok🙈🙈
2019/08/03, 11:39 - Sechaba: She's only moving there next year though?
2019/08/03, 11:40 - Lungelo: Yes
2019/08/03, 11:41 - Sechaba: But please put together your list of expectations and parameters☝🏾
2019/08/03, 11:41 - Lungelo: Same with you
2019/08/03, 11:50 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2019/08/04, 13:35 - Sechaba: Please let me know when you've put your list together.
2019/08/04, 21:24 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/04, 21:32 - Sechaba: I put mine on paper.
2019/08/04, 21:33 - Lungelo: Ok
2019/08/04, 21:33 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/08/04, 21:38 - Lungelo: Please email this to me.
2019/08/04, 21:38 - Lungelo: My phone doesn't have word
2019/08/04, 21:41 - Sechaba: Expectations
Privacy – each person has an impregnable right to privacy. Bedrooms are sacrosanct and basic etiquette such as knocking is the general rule. 
Cleanliness – everyone cleans their own mess. Barring the periodic cleaning of several rooms, you pay as you go. 
Clear communication – issues are dealt with promptly, honestly, and tactfully.  Movements in and out the flat are communicated where appropriate. 
Some cost sharing – where mutually beneficial, costs will be shared. Most likely food, cleaning items, and utilities. Like the cleaning, each person pays for what they use. 
Fun – everyone is entitled to their own social life. This includes bringing friends over, going out, and sleeping over at other people’s homes. When hosting an event at the flat, this should generally be done on the weekend. All events held at the flat should be discussed with the other party beforehand. 
Exception: Rules are more flexible with girlfriends and are subject to revision at any point. 
A bit of noise – noise in the form of singing, musical instruments, or social activity is allowed. If highly bothersome to the other person, strict periods for noise making will need to be agreed upon.   
Good vibes – everyone should strive to make the flat a pleasant place to be in. It means straining topics such as work politics and a generally negative disposition are not the norm.  
Priorities
1.	Location (as close to Sandton as possible)
2.	Fast and reliable internet
3.	Decent shower
4.	Parking space
5.	Spacious room
Parameters
•	Subject to confirmation later but looking to spend between 4000 and 5500 on rent.
•	Ideally just you and me but maximum three people if the situation requires. 
•	Not looking to spend money on cleaners, but somewhat flexible
•	Spending on other household items would need to be discussed in person. Barring essentials such as a fridge and a couch, my spending would largely be in line with my priorities. 
General suggestions
•	Clear communication
•	Establishing some house rules
•	Purchasing a pair of good headphones or ear plugs
Key peculiarities
•	I prefer doing some things alone rather than in groups e.g. watching movies. 
•	I thoroughly enjoy my alone time and will likely default to this
•	I can be extremely spontaneous at times
•	I am both a night and a morning person (mostly morning)
2019/08/04, 21:45 - Lungelo: I thought you were talking about finding a place. 

I'll address the expectations stuff tomorrow. Sorry I'm a bit distracted at the moment

2019/08/13, 10:42 - Lungelo: I'm only joining that next year. But FirstRand gives us a bloated salary and we have to choose our own funds.
2019/08/13, 10:48 - Sechaba: Oh ok cool. I also have to do my own thing. I was wondering if that's standard practice.
2019/08/13, 15:50 - Sechaba: I'm officially going to be working in Sandton.
2019/08/13, 15:57 - Lungelo: Yes. They just contribute to whatever you pick.
2019/08/13, 15:57 - Lungelo: Really? Which company?
2019/08/13, 15:59 - Sechaba: Monocle.
2019/08/13, 18:25 - Lungelo: Congratulations! Why did you choose them?! And when do you start?
2019/08/13, 19:03 - Sechaba: Thank you. I chose them for the money. I start in Jan.
2019/08/13, 19:05 - Lungelo: How much will you get if you dont mind me asking.
2019/08/13, 19:05 - Lungelo: You already know what I get and Im sure its more than me
2019/08/13, 19:06 - Lungelo: Always a wise choice I guess in 2019
2019/08/13, 19:07 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/08/13, 19:14 - Lungelo: Lol no! I chose FRB for money as much as, if not more, for what they do. Need to bag the coin.
2019/08/13, 19:16 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/13, 19:33 - Sechaba: 😂😂😂😂
2019/08/13, 19:35 - Sechaba: I honestly thought you were tipsy for a moment.
2019/08/13, 19:39 - Sechaba: But you make sense. This means you'll likely not be working as an accountant in the future right?
2019/08/13, 19:44 - Lungelo: I honestly feel like you dont know me as well as I thought...
2019/08/13, 19:46 - Lungelo: I don't know what my future looks like at the moment...
2019/08/13, 19:46 - Lungelo: I want to be a Chartered Accountant for a very long time yes, but I dont
2019/08/13, 19:46 - Lungelo: I dont know what I'll do with it...
2019/08/13, 20:32 - Sechaba: Haha🙈
2019/08/13, 20:33 - Sechaba: But banking is the simplest way to move away from that right?
2019/08/13, 20:34 - Lungelo: You mean moving away from being a boring auditor yes. I'll be a CA in business. In the thick of corporate.
2019/08/13, 20:40 - Lungelo: You get the designation wherever you qualify. As long as it is saica accredited. You're all under one qualifying house. You just have different skills.
2019/08/13, 20:57 - Sechaba: Yes, this is what I meant.
2019/08/13, 21:00 - Lungelo: I can never become an auditor with the route I took... which has its pros and cons
2019/08/13, 21:01 - Sechaba: I back the decision.
2019/08/13, 21:07 - Lungelo: Im yet to find out if its the right one.
2019/08/13, 21:09 - Sechaba: 🤞🏾
2019/08/18, 15:20 - Sechaba: Where do you host your blog?
2019/08/18, 15:21 - Lungelo: WordPress
2019/08/18, 15:21 - Lungelo: Do you want to start your own?
2019/08/18, 15:22 - Sechaba: Just WordPress?
2019/08/18, 15:22 - Sechaba: No. It's for my mom.
2019/08/18, 15:22 - Lungelo: Yes
2019/08/18, 15:22 - Lungelo: So you create your domain name on wordpress
2019/08/18, 15:23 - Lungelo: So then my domain name is Linesbylungelo
2019/08/18, 15:23 - Lungelo: Then WordPress gave me the ".wordpress.com" portion
2019/08/18, 15:23 - Lungelo: Ah cool what does she want to write about
2019/08/18, 15:24 - Lungelo: There are different things that you can create on wordpress. You can create a website or you can create a blog. Blogs are free.
2019/08/18, 15:24 - Sechaba: Cool. Thanks🙌🏽
2019/08/18, 15:24 - Sechaba: I don't know.
2019/08/18, 15:25 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/18, 15:26 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/18, 15:30 - Sechaba: It's for my mom. I haven't asked what it's for.
2019/08/18, 15:44 - Sechaba: Please don't forget about the list. If you're still keen to live together then I'd like to start collecting some things we can use next year.
2019/08/18, 15:46 - Lungelo: What things do you want to start collecting?
2019/08/18, 15:48 - Sechaba: Anything really. I've got plates and a coffee table secured so far.
2019/08/18, 15:49 - Sechaba: + determine which things I'll need to start saving for.
2019/08/18, 16:08 - Lungelo: That depends on the aesthetics of the flat
2019/08/18, 16:12 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/18, 17:10 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/18, 20:06 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/08/18, 20:13 - Lungelo: What's wrong with being Muslim or Hindu? 😂😂😂My closest friend is Hindu and we talk about *everything*
2019/08/18, 20:15 - Lungelo: 👍🏾
2019/08/18, 20:18 - Sechaba: What's going to happen if I ask you to pray for me?
2019/08/18, 20:18 - Lungelo: Do you have to ask me to pray for you?
2019/08/18, 20:23 - Sechaba: It could happen🤷🏽‍♂
2019/08/18, 20:24 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/18, 20:29 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/08/19, 06:55 - Sechaba: *I start on the 2nd. You can just stay at my house for a couple of days if needed.
2019/08/29, 19:04 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/08/29, 23:19 - Lungelo: Lmao there's no tax "threshold" for companies. There's a flat rate of 28%. Whether you made R5 or R500 000 PBT
2019/08/29, 23:20 - Lungelo: That's tax avoidance
2019/08/29, 23:21 - Lungelo: But SARS already made provision for that. It's called a s7 anti-avoidance rule. SARS will tax you on the market related portion of that allocation and will deem the excess amount as the profits of the company...
2019/08/29, 23:22 - Lungelo: But that normally works with spouses where you pay your spouse more money in order to relieve your tax burden... like a doctor's surgery. The wife being a secretary or something.
2019/08/29, 23:27 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/29, 23:36 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/08/30, 12:50 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/08/30, 16:15 - Lungelo: Companies have no tax brackets or tax thresholds. Just a flat rate
2019/08/30, 16:59 - Sechaba: Yes, I know that. But they don't pay tax on losses right?
2019/08/30, 23:14 - Lungelo: Yes
2019/08/30, 23:14 - Lungelo: They don't. Same as natural people though...
2019/09/01, 09:33 - Lungelo: If you can link your expenses to the company then you can defs use investment income through the company as well as your expenses. It becomes grey if SARS audits you. 

The company won't pay Div tax on local dividends because it's almost a double exemption 1. From normal tax and 2. Div tax. It's weird but they already get so much crap from the other taxes.
2019/09/01, 09:36 - Lungelo: Dividends won't move you out of your bracket as a natural person because it's exempt from income tax. You'd pay the 20% Div tax.

With a company, div income is essentially tax free.
2019/09/02, 13:01 - Sechaba: Thank you. So it could work but I'd want to have a good lawyer.
2019/09/02, 14:24 - Lungelo: Lol
2019/09/09, 22:37 - Lungelo: I'm thinking of pulling through to JHB in October. That last week or so 😬
2019/09/10, 08:05 - Sechaba: What's happening in JHB?
2019/09/10, 08:13 - Lungelo: Viewings Sechaba viewings. And to check out the place in general
2019/09/10, 08:20 - Sechaba: Yeah, that's what I thought. But I would think November makes more sense. At the moment, most places want someone moving in within 2 months.
2019/09/10, 08:33 - Lungelo: November is exam marking under tight deadlines
2019/09/10, 08:33 - Lungelo: I'm not sure if I'll get leave then
2019/09/10, 08:36 - Sechaba: Ah, makes sense. See you in October then☝🏾
2019/09/10, 09:01 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/09/11, 21:51 - Sechaba: Are you bringing friends over to Joburg btw?
2019/09/11, 21:51 - Lungelo: What do you mean?
2019/09/11, 21:53 - Sechaba: Are some of your squad members going to be in Joburg next year?
2019/09/11, 21:54 - Lungelo: I don't have a squad lol
2019/09/11, 21:55 - Lungelo: Ntokozo is coming up. She'll be working at EY
2019/09/11, 21:55 - Lungelo: A few other people are coming up/ already there. Lolo and Nhla...
2019/09/11, 21:56 - Lungelo: Apart from them... There's no one really 🤔
2019/09/11, 21:56 - Lungelo: Why'd you ask
2019/09/11, 21:57 - Sechaba: My mom wants me to check out houses. If something amazing does come up for 3 people, I wanted to know...
2019/09/11, 22:00 - Lungelo: Oh if a third person could join🤔
2019/09/11, 22:01 - Lungelo: We can try find something 🤷🏾‍♂  

Property24 has this weird listing. 3 bed for R9000. If the 2 of us get that then we have a spare room for guests🤷🏾‍♂ Or a 3rs person... 
We'll figure someth out.
2019/09/11, 22:03 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/09/11, 22:11 - Lungelo: Ibrahim is vice prim
2019/09/11, 22:11 - Lungelo: And Eugene is Prim
2019/09/11, 22:11 - Lungelo: Of huis div. 2020
2019/09/11, 22:12 - Lungelo: Neil's parents also have a place apparently
2019/09/11, 22:12 - Lungelo: He told me briefly.
2019/09/11, 22:12 - Lungelo: Lol why does it have to blow your mind 😅
2019/09/11, 22:13 - Lungelo: I'll think about it and get back to you.
2019/09/11, 23:02 - Sechaba: What?!😱
2019/09/11, 23:03 - Sechaba: We need to use these connections.
2019/09/11, 23:04 - Sechaba: I'm fussy.
2019/09/15, 16:56 - Sechaba: 🙋🏾‍♂
2019/09/16, 16:55 - Sechaba: How are the cycling classes coming along?
2019/09/16, 17:15 - Lungelo: None existent duh
2019/09/16, 17:16 - Lungelo: You're in JHB
2019/09/16, 17:16 - Lungelo: I need for Matt's wedding
2019/09/16, 18:40 - Sechaba: Russel!
2019/09/16, 18:40 - Sechaba: Forward thinking. Nice.
2019/09/16, 18:41 - Lungelo: He's busy. We barely see him.
2019/09/16, 18:41 - Lungelo: Again. Sometimes I feel like you don't even know me
2019/09/16, 18:42 - Sechaba: But then again you had me as your neighbour, you knew I went to opskop every other Friday and you didn't make a plan😐
2019/09/16, 18:44 - Lungelo: BAccHons vs Sokkie bruh
2019/09/16, 19:18 - Sechaba: What about earlier this year?
2019/09/16, 19:36 - Lungelo: It was a mess. I was trying to prove myself at work. That turned out well...
2019/09/16, 19:36 - Lungelo: And I worked insane hours
2019/09/16, 19:42 - Sechaba: Okay okay. Let's just focus on the classes then. Why don't you ask Neil?
2019/09/16, 19:43 - Lungelo: I just did. Waiting for a response. BAccLLB fourth year is the hardest year... so he's going through the most.
2019/09/16, 19:43 - Lungelo: You sound frustrated. "okay okay"
2019/09/16, 19:45 - Sechaba: No I'm not. The argument was getting circular and pretty so I decided to end it.
2019/09/16, 19:46 - Sechaba: I back him to do a good job.
2019/09/16, 19:46 - Lungelo: lol pretty 😂😂😂
2019/09/16, 19:47 - Sechaba: Otherwise you can crash a huisdans somewhere.
2019/09/16, 19:47 - Sechaba: *petty🙈
2019/09/16, 19:47 - Lungelo: Baccllb or teaching me how to sokkie
2019/09/16, 19:47 - Sechaba: Sokkie
2019/09/16, 19:47 - Lungelo: Its 4th term
2019/09/16, 19:48 - Sechaba: Eendrag usually has one around this time.
2019/09/16, 19:48 - Lungelo: We'll see if he can pull through
2019/09/16, 19:48 - Lungelo: You forget that I am a lecturer
2019/09/16, 19:48 - Sechaba: Yolo
2019/09/16, 19:48 - Lungelo: To over 400 students between 188, 288 and Hons
2019/09/16, 19:49 - Lungelo: I'm moving to JHB is that not enough yolo for a while
2019/09/16, 19:49 - Sechaba: If you learn how to ride a bike it will be enough
2019/09/16, 19:50 - Lungelo: Why is this so important to you
2019/09/16, 19:50 - Lungelo: I can be you protege in other things 🙄 if it makes you sleep at night.
2019/09/16, 19:53 - Sechaba: 😔
2019/09/16, 19:58 - Lungelo: what
2019/09/16, 19:58 - Lungelo: ek vra maar net
2019/09/16, 20:32 - Sechaba: What are you asking?
2019/09/16, 20:41 - Lungelo: .
2019/09/16, 21:00 - Sechaba: It's a relatively easy and useful skill that everyone should learn. The fact that you're afraid to learn is more reason why you should do it.
2019/09/16, 21:03 - Lungelo: Im not afraid to learn... its just not a priority at the moment
2019/09/16, 21:03 - Lungelo: But I hear what you are saying
2019/09/21, 20:05 - Lungelo: I bought curtains😅
2019/09/21, 20:05 - Lungelo: The sheer ones that go under the main ones
2019/09/21, 20:07 - Lungelo: You can start getting that for your room... as well as a bed... and carpets and a table with a comfy chair... and a side board where you can put on a reading lamp... and a chest of drawers of you're that person
2019/09/21, 20:07 - Lungelo: Black Friday is the place to be
2019/09/21, 20:08 - Sechaba: Why did you start with curtains?
2019/09/21, 20:08 - Sechaba: I totally forgot about Black Friday. I'm not sure if I'll have then though.
2019/09/21, 20:08 - Lungelo: That's what you need urgently
2019/09/21, 20:09 - Lungelo: Otherwise people will see  you getting naked and shit
2019/09/21, 20:09 - Lungelo: Depending on where we stay
2019/09/21, 20:09 - Sechaba: Makes sense.
2019/09/21, 20:09 - Lungelo: I'll get a bed in Dec when we secure a place
2019/09/21, 20:10 - Lungelo: 😂😂😂my whole year is revolving around it 🙈
2019/09/21, 20:10 - Sechaba: *money
2019/09/21, 20:10 - Sechaba: Where do you plan to store everything?
2019/09/21, 20:11 - Lungelo: Borrow. The savings you make then will compensate the interest if its less than 20%
2019/09/21, 20:11 - Lungelo: Nhla's flat in Midrand
2019/09/21, 20:11 - Lungelo: Or at the flat if we have secured it
2019/09/21, 20:11 - Lungelo: Or I can just ask the furniture companies to hold onto it and deliver on the 2nd or 3rd of Jan
2019/09/21, 20:12 - Lungelo: I already moved most of my books up
2019/09/21, 20:12 - Sechaba: ☝🏾
2019/09/21, 20:13 - Sechaba: Any chance you've drawn up a comprehensive list of everything you (I) will need?
2019/09/21, 20:13 - Lungelo: Lol in my mind yes
2019/09/21, 20:13 - Sechaba: This makes sense.
2019/09/21, 20:16 - Lungelo: 1. Bed
2. Sheer curtains
3. *Lined* curtains 
4. Bedding and sheets to fit (more than one to change out)
5. Blankets
6. Heater
7. Carpets for the room
8. Headboard and 
 Side board (nice to have)
9. Table and chair if I need to work or need to get ready
10. Full length mirror

That pretty much covers the room
2019/09/21, 20:16 - Lungelo: Then general...

1. Fridge 
2. Microwave 
3. Washing machine
4. Kettle 
5. Hand beater (coz I wanna bake)
2019/09/21, 20:17 - Lungelo: Carpets

Bathroom mats after showering

2019/09/21, 20:21 - Sechaba: Thank you. This is perfect🙌🏽
2019/09/21, 20:22 - Lungelo: 🙌🏾
2019/09/21, 20:22 - Sechaba: I'll maybe get one with the family on it.
2019/09/21, 20:25 - Lungelo: For your room yes😅
2019/09/21, 20:25 - Lungelo: I meant for the common spaces
2019/09/21, 20:27 - Sechaba: You want us to have pictures of ourselves in the common areas?
2019/09/21, 20:33 - Lungelo: Yes...
2019/09/21, 20:33 - Lungelo: Well just one
2019/09/21, 20:33 - Lungelo: Of eavh
2019/09/21, 20:33 - Lungelo: A3 CANVAS
2019/09/21, 20:50 - Sechaba: I'll give it some more thought but you're welcome to put your picture up🙌🏽
2019/09/21, 20:52 - Lungelo: I need to have it taken. Otherwise I'll just put it at home 😂
2019/09/21, 20:58 - Sechaba: Yeah, you should do it. Get it taken at a proper place.
2019/09/21, 20:59 - Lungelo: Suggestions
2019/09/21, 21:08 - Sechaba: None🙈
2019/09/21, 21:09 - Lungelo: Lol
2019/09/21, 21:10 - Lungelo: Comment disqualified
2019/09/21, 21:26 - Sechaba: You deleted this message
2019/09/21, 21:26 - Sechaba: *Google.
2019/09/21, 21:26 - Lungelo: I saw that
2019/09/21, 21:26 - Lungelo: Comment disqualified
2019/09/23, 00:18 - Lungelo: This guy
2019/09/23, 00:18 - Lungelo: Ibra
2019/09/23, 00:19 - Lungelo: busy telling people that I did a terrible job at hooking him up with someone and that he didn't like Nomzee
2019/09/23, 00:19 - Lungelo: Im yet to see how do better. Doos
2019/09/23, 08:16 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/09/23, 09:56 - Lungelo: I don't get it
2019/09/23, 10:00 - Sechaba: Spice.
2019/09/23, 10:01 - Lungelo: From  me or him
2019/09/23, 10:02 - Sechaba: The whole situation.
2019/09/23, 10:03 - Sechaba: It's got spice.
2019/09/23, 10:03 - Sechaba: Did you talk to him?
2019/09/23, 10:05 - Lungelo: 😂😂😂😂
2019/09/23, 10:05 - Lungelo: Yes I confronted and he admitted
2019/09/23, 10:15 - Sechaba: What happens now?
2019/09/23, 10:17 - Lungelo: Nothing
2019/09/23, 10:17 - Lungelo: Just letting you know😅 the disrespect
2019/09/23, 10:19 - Sechaba: Haha maybe you should try again.
2019/09/23, 10:19 - Lungelo: No
2019/09/23, 10:19 - Sechaba: Or have him set you up as an apology.
2019/09/23, 10:19 - Lungelo: I'm pre-occupied with other things. Esp the next 3 weeks
2019/09/23, 10:20 - Lungelo: 😒
2019/09/23, 10:20 - Lungelo: Funny guy
2019/09/23, 10:21 - Sechaba: At least I know now not to set Ibra up. Don't want him running my reputation as a match maker.
2019/09/23, 10:30 - Lungelo: It's more my reputation than yours
2019/09/23, 10:31 - Lungelo: How does the next few weeks look like from a viewing perspective
2019/09/23, 12:56 - Sechaba: What? Are we still talking about matchmaking?
2019/09/23, 16:23 - Lungelo: Lmao no
2019/09/23, 16:23 - Lungelo: Accommodation
2019/09/23, 16:23 - Lungelo: Priorities dude
2019/09/23, 16:26 - Sechaba: Debatable.
2019/09/23, 16:27 - Sechaba: I'm going to check out the house (s) on Friday.
2019/09/23, 16:27 - Lungelo: Which ones
2019/09/23, 16:27 - Lungelo: Send pics and location
2019/09/23, 16:28 - Lungelo: Would you rather have p*ssy or a roof over your head?
2019/09/23, 16:38 - Sechaba: The ones my mom suggested. I don't have pics or location yet.
2019/09/23, 16:50 - Lungelo: Send
2019/09/23, 16:51 - Sechaba: What?
2019/09/23, 16:53 - Lungelo: Okay nvm read wrong
2019/09/23, 18:46 - Sechaba: Are you sure you calculated properly?
2019/09/23, 20:28 - Lungelo: I excluded Nov coz my hands are tied
2019/09/23, 20:29 - Lungelo: I thought about it all
2019/09/23, 21:21 - Sechaba: Oh. Just making sure you're not counting your chickens.
2019/09/23, 21:47 - Lungelo: Please  explain
2019/09/23, 21:47 - Lungelo: Is th saying not counting your chickens before they hatch? Which in this case is completely inappropriate 😅
2019/09/23, 21:53 - Sechaba: Why inappropriate?
2019/09/23, 21:53 - Lungelo: I'm taking the conservative end of the stick
2019/09/23, 21:53 - Lungelo: That saying normally applies to the optimistic viewm
2019/09/23, 21:53 - Lungelo: View *
2019/09/23, 22:10 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/09/23, 22:25 - Lungelo: And how is your master's going? Did you end up finishing?
2019/09/23, 22:51 - Sechaba: This is an optimistic situation. You can't wait to come to Joburg and you're counting down the days until you're released.
2019/09/23, 22:56 - Lungelo: No
2019/09/23, 22:56 - Lungelo: I actually can wait
2019/09/23, 22:57 - Lungelo: I'm uncertain you see, so there's nothing really calling me there
2019/09/23, 22:56 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/09/23, 22:59 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/09/23, 23:01 - Lungelo: I dont remember you saying it'll be a plan B. Awe cool man.
2019/09/23, 23:02 - Lungelo: Look at you placing priority on German. colonial words.
2019/09/23, 23:02 - Lungelo: Advise= bonisa or ukuchushisa
2019/09/23, 23:03 - Lungelo: lol who was advising you
2019/09/23, 23:03 - Lungelo: Thats also one.
2019/09/23, 23:03 - Lungelo: Yes
2019/09/24, 08:21 - Sechaba: A house will have more than two rooms. Since we said the ideal is a place with two rooms...
2019/09/24, 08:23 - Sechaba: Look at you using colonial words to type out that sentence.
2019/09/24, 08:24 - Sechaba: Someone said on TV.
2019/09/24, 08:25 - Sechaba: I'm discovery that Zulu has elements similar to German. And that's it's actually a pretty difficult language.
2019/09/24, 19:02 - Lungelo: Hence I never took it in high school. Can't put myself through that.
2019/09/24, 21:05 - Lungelo: https://www.property24.com/to-rent/dainfern-ridge/sandton/gauteng/10864/107471661?plId=448815&plt=2
2019/09/24, 21:26 - Sechaba: I think we get something even closer?
2019/09/24, 21:26 - Sechaba: https://www.property24.com/to-rent/sandton-central/sandton/gauteng/16732/107617385
2019/09/24, 21:26 - Sechaba: Not as good as the other one, but much closer.
2019/09/24, 21:52 - Lungelo: Hectic this is behind FirstRand
2019/09/24, 21:52 - Lungelo: Its by the JSE
2019/09/24, 21:52 - Lungelo: We can look...
2019/09/24, 21:52 - Lungelo: Which means its really close to Alex
2019/09/25, 08:11 - Sechaba: I wasn't necessarily suggesting that specific one. I wanted to give you an idea of the kind of places we could still find that are closer.
2019/09/25, 08:12 - Sechaba: If you're worried about safety, you don't need to be. This is Joburg. There's crime everywhere.

2019/09/30, 22:03 - Sechaba: What viewing?
2019/09/30, 22:03 - Sechaba: Cool. We might end up travelling together to the CBD.
2019/09/30, 22:04 - Lungelo: For the 10k one
2019/09/30, 22:04 - Lungelo: I thought Monocle was in  Sandton
2019/09/30, 22:04 - Lungelo: The One behind FRB
2019/09/30, 22:09 - Sechaba: Monocle does consultancy.
2019/09/30, 22:09 - Sechaba: I'll see if I can make time. That place was for Oct or Nov though.
2019/09/30, 22:13 - Lungelo: Just to see. And ask if it can start Jan
2019/09/30, 22:14 - Lungelo: Oh okay

2019/10/04, 23:24 - Lungelo: From Harmonie
2019/10/04, 23:25 - Lungelo: That's why I can't breathe
2019/10/04, 23:25 - Lungelo: The white chick, chubby one. We spoke about philosophy with her a lot
2019/10/04, 23:26 - Sechaba: It's funny but I really feel sorry for him.

2019/10/04, 23:40 - Lungelo: Lol who else has interests with each other between Harmonie and Huis Div
2019/10/04, 23:40 - Lungelo: Give us a time to video call

Marking
2019/10/04, 23:54 - Sechaba: Haha yeah, I think I was prepared. But also, in light of Ibra's recent drama, this is just a sequel.
2019/10/04, 23:54 - Sechaba: It will have to be later that week otherwise.
2019/10/04, 23:54 - Lungelo: What are you talking about

2019/10/12, 21:57 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/10/13, 07:43 - Lungelo: Were you at a karaoke bar or something 👀👀👀
2019/10/13, 07:44 - Lungelo: Yeah no it wasn't going to work.
2019/10/13, 09:07 - Sechaba: Indeed.
2019/10/13, 09:42 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/10/13, 09:42 - Lungelo: It's quite vulgar but it's got a lot of practical tips
2019/10/13, 09:42 - Lungelo: Take it or leave it type of thing
2019/10/13, 14:06 - Sechaba: I don't think he'll appreciate it if it's vulgar.
2019/10/13, 15:38 - Lungelo: Thought as much.
2019/10/13, 15:38 - Lungelo: But I wanted to write: don't flinch
2019/10/13, 15:57 - Sechaba: But you could get him a similarly useful book that doesn't contain vulgar.
2019/10/13, 16:40 - Lungelo: I don't know of any other of it's kind
2019/10/13, 16:41 - Lungelo: Unless if I ask the author to rewrite
2019/10/13, 16:50 - Sechaba: It can't be that difficult. Just go to Amazon and Goodreads. Find the book and the sites should recommend books that are similar. Read the reviews and then choose one.
2019/10/16, 18:25 - Lungelo: Hey there
2019/10/16, 18:26 - Lungelo: Hows flat hunting going?
2019/10/16, 18:26 - Lungelo: Im looking but there aren't a lot of attractive places anymore...
2019/10/16, 18:27 - Lungelo: Besides finding a place we actually need to chat quickly about some of the stuff that we will need (communally) and who's going to buy what when... coz Black Friday is coming up so it would be great to score on a fridge, microwave, washing machine and bedroom things...
2019/10/16, 19:46 - Sechaba: Yeah, I feel the same way. I was looking on Monday.
2019/10/16, 19:47 - Sechaba: Yeah, we should.

2019/10/23, 19:14 - Sechaba: You said you want the en suite though?
2019/10/23, 19:15 - Lungelo: Well I have other aspirations that need my money so if push comes to shove I will give up the en suite to afford a nice area

2019/11/09, 21:38 - Lungelo: Carpets are a no no
2019/11/09, 21:39 - Lungelo: Missed voice call
2019/11/10, 13:17 - Sechaba: That's on the ground. Ours would be on the top floor (4th).
2019/11/10, 13:18 - Sechaba: Yes. She's happy.
2019/11/10, 13:18 - Sechaba: 21500.
2019/11/10, 13:18 - Sechaba: Both.
2019/11/10, 13:19 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>

2019/11/10, 16:27 - Lungelo: I'll be able to pay long before then
2019/11/10, 16:27 - Lungelo: The 21 500
2019/11/10, 16:27 - Lungelo: But not at once. So the first PMT would happen beg Dec and the other Mid-Dec
2019/11/10, 16:28 - Lungelo: Don't you want to view the other places before we put in an offer 🙈
2019/11/10, 16:38 - Sechaba: Ok cool.
2019/11/10, 16:38 - Sechaba: Not really. Do you?
2019/11/10, 16:39 - Lungelo: Options are always good
2019/11/10, 16:40 - Lungelo: So if we pay R21500 its both deposit and Jan rent! Awesome
2019/11/10, 17:10 - Sechaba: We had 4 options yesterday. We settled on 1.
2019/11/10, 17:11 - Lungelo: Options on offers in case this one doesn't go through
2019/11/10, 17:11 - Lungelo: By the ou
2019/11/10, 17:12 - Lungelo: sound of things the others weren't really options
2019/11/12, 09:39 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo. Did you get my email?
2019/11/12, 10:02 - Lungelo: I did
2019/11/12, 10:03 - Lungelo: Do they have a telkom connection?
2019/11/12, 10:03 - Lungelo: For internet
2019/11/12, 10:03 - Lungelo: I will attend to it soonest
2019/11/12, 10:15 - Sechaba: The fibre line is provided by MetroFibre but we can use other ISPs.
2019/11/12, 10:15 - Sechaba: Why do you ask?
2019/11/12, 10:38 - Lungelo: Just asking
2019/11/12, 10:48 - Lungelo: Please email me your ID
2019/11/12, 10:48 - Lungelo: They want both
2019/11/12, 10:54 - Sechaba: Ok cool. I also need to send you three months bank statement.
2019/11/12, 10:59 - Lungelo: Well everything that's on that list
2019/11/12, 11:00 - Lungelo: A FICA document is for your proof of address
2019/11/12, 11:04 - Sechaba: Yeah. She said my bank statement will suffice if it has my current address.
2019/11/12, 11:07 - Sechaba: But should I not be the one to send them. It will make things easier since I've been chatting to her already.
2019/11/12, 11:10 - Lungelo: I was cc'd in the email as well you know
2019/11/12, 11:10 - Lungelo: So it doesn't matter
2019/11/12, 11:16 - Sechaba: Ok.
2019/11/13, 19:44 - Lungelo: Bra could you please organise one more viewing 🙏🏾
2019/11/13, 19:44 - Lungelo: It's not guaranteed that we will get that place
2019/11/13, 23:23 - Sechaba: Why not?
2019/11/14, 00:09 - Lungelo: It's just not. I've been through this many times. Other people come. Or they sell the place and the people wanna live in it... or some random stuff that happens. We need to  at least have one more alternative.
2019/11/14, 08:25 - Sechaba: All the units are the same and are rented out by the same agents. The prices are standard, they currently have multiple units available, and they are building up more units.
2019/11/14, 14:07 - Sechaba: I spoke to Jayson and he has done his checks and he has approved you guys 😊
2019/11/14, 16:52 - Lungelo: Can we get this is writing please 🙏🏾

Also ask them when they are sending the contract through
2019/11/14, 16:52 - Lungelo: If you insist.
2019/11/14, 17:19 - Sechaba: Calm down.
2019/11/17, 00:45 - Lungelo: Remember this when I'm busy and not replying to your messages or taking your calls
2019/11/19, 18:34 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/11/19, 18:46 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/11/19, 20:03 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/11/19, 20:22 - Lungelo: I got it ✌🏾

Haven't read it yet. But I already have questions before I sign on the stuff that's not there just from scanning... so I'm going to have changes made possibly.
2019/11/19, 20:22 - Lungelo: Which credit card are you getting
2019/11/19, 20:22 - Lungelo: And what's your limit
2019/11/19, 20:22 - Lungelo: Do they have a lift 😭😭😭
2019/11/19, 20:24 - Lungelo: It takes a month to apply for internet connection so we'll need to get on with that.
2019/11/19, 20:24 - Lungelo: In Dec
2019/11/19, 20:25 - Lungelo: I don't know exactly how much I'll earn so I can't really say much on the internet situation 😬😬😬
2019/11/19, 20:26 - Lungelo: The maintenance is from the deposit... But for damages not for wear and tear. We report wear and tear issues to the owners as they occur and they come fix it... like a burst pipe or a geyser or some shit.
2019/11/19, 20:26 - Lungelo: So if we break a window that's out of the deposit
2019/11/19, 20:29 - Sechaba: Cool👍🏾
2019/11/19, 20:29 - Sechaba: One from Standard Bank.
2019/11/19, 20:30 - Sechaba: Don't know.
2019/11/19, 20:30 - Sechaba: To the apartment?
2019/11/19, 20:31 - Lungelo: to our floor
2019/11/19, 20:31 - Lungelo: yes
2019/11/19, 20:31 - Sechaba: When do you find out?
2019/11/19, 20:31 - Lungelo: And how many windows do they have in the apartment?
2019/11/19, 20:31 - Sechaba: No. We're on the 4th (top) floor.
2019/11/19, 20:31 - Lungelo: How big do you think
2019/11/19, 20:32 - Lungelo: Fuck. No lift to the top floor. okay cool
2019/11/19, 20:32 - Lungelo: When I'm there
2019/11/19, 20:32 - Sechaba: I think 3 (bedrooms + kitchen) + sliding door.
2019/11/19, 20:33 - Sechaba: I told them 50.
2019/11/19, 20:33 - Lungelo: hebana. Who's doing this application for you. That's the first thing they tell you
2019/11/19, 20:33 - Sechaba: Why do you want a lift?
2019/11/19, 20:33 - Lungelo: No man I mean the windows
2019/11/19, 20:34 - Lungelo: That's a shit load of money
2019/11/19, 20:34 - Lungelo: I saw blinds in the bathroom are they there?
2019/11/19, 20:35 - Lungelo: Or we must put for ourselves
2019/11/19, 20:35 - Lungelo: And what colour are the walls?
2019/11/19, 20:35 - Sechaba: But they say up to 250k.
2019/11/19, 20:35 - Lungelo: 😨😨😨
2019/11/19, 20:36 - Sechaba: I don't remember🙈 I think bigger than normal. The rooms had good sunlight.
2019/11/19, 20:37 - Sechaba: I believe white.
2019/11/19, 20:37 - Lungelo: Oh my fuck
2019/11/19, 20:37 - Lungelo: Can't we ask them to make it cream or beige
2019/11/19, 20:37 - Sechaba: Can't remember what's in the bathroom🙈
2019/11/19, 20:37 - Lungelo: White walls are the devil's work
2019/11/19, 20:38 - Sechaba: Should I give you Charlene's number and you can ask about the specifics?
2019/11/19, 20:38 - Lungelo: Please ask the lady or go for a second viewing. Need to know the essentials for when we move in
2019/11/19, 20:39 - Lungelo: No shame she'll hate me for asking all this stuff
2019/11/19, 20:39 - Lungelo: Or maybe I'll ask in the email when I submit my contract
2019/11/19, 20:41 - Sechaba: Why do we need to know these things?
2019/11/19, 20:42 - Lungelo: 1. Window size = curtain size
2019/11/19, 20:43 - Lungelo: 2. Paint colour = deposit being used to repaint because white walls always change colour. And to decide on the colour appliances and shit to buy
2019/11/19, 20:43 - Lungelo: Blinds are expensive so we'll go for curtains
2019/11/19, 20:48 - Sechaba: Wallpaper☝🏾
2019/11/19, 20:48 - Sechaba: Wise for you to see the walls + room before you buy curtains.
2019/11/19, 20:48 - Lungelo: True... But if they don't mind painting it for us and letting it dry then we don't have to pay🤷🏾‍♂
2019/11/19, 20:49 - Lungelo: I already bought the lace curtains...
2019/11/19, 20:49 - Lungelo: It's to cover for the first few weeks at least. If you don't like it I can always take it home or whatever
2019/11/19, 20:50 - Sechaba: Did you buy two sets?
2019/11/19, 20:50 - Sechaba: Or is this for the living room?
2019/11/19, 20:50 - Sechaba: *for the bedrooms.
2019/11/19, 20:51 - Lungelo: Yes. For the sliding door. I already have one lace curtain for my room hence I asked if there are other places that need a voil curtain in the common areas to close em up
2019/11/19, 20:52 - Sechaba: Oh. Ok cool. I think it depends where the sliding door faces.
2019/11/19, 21:06 - Lungelo: ...
2019/11/20, 09:29 - Sechaba: I've had a quick look at the wifi stuff. I believe we don't have to pay extra to rent the line so if we get a 10m line then it'll be around 600.
2019/11/20, 09:30 - Lungelo: Why 10m? Won't we get a router rather?
2019/11/20, 09:30 - Lungelo: Then keep it close to the line
2019/11/20, 09:34 - Sechaba: *10mbps
2019/11/20, 09:35 - Sechaba: 800 for a 25mbps line.
2019/11/20, 16:50 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/11/20, 19:46 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/11/20, 19:57 - Lungelo: The current line is good as well
2019/11/20, 19:57 - Lungelo: It doesn't buffer or anything
2019/11/20, 19:57 - Lungelo: At it doesn't throth or whatever they call it.
2019/11/20, 19:58 - Lungelo: So it's the same speed from the beg till the end
2019/11/20, 19:58 - Lungelo: That's the biggest thing
2019/11/20, 20:08 - Sechaba: Great👌🏾

2019/11/22, 09:54 - Lungelo: We may have to get 2 eventually
2019/11/22, 09:54 - Lungelo: Coz we work during the week so the chances of doing laundry then are slim

2019/11/22, 11:37 - Lungelo: And I'll fly back with my drivers
2019/11/22, 11:37 - Lungelo: I will also give you the curtains and the hooks on Sat so that you can put them up when you move in
2019/11/22, 11:37 - Lungelo: I only start on the 7th of January so I'll come through just before that.
2019/11/22, 11:51 - Sechaba: Why?
2019/11/22, 11:51 - Sechaba: Why are you only telling me this now?
2019/11/22, 12:57 - Lungelo: Because I kept forgetting to tel you
2019/11/22, 14:19 - Sechaba: We can discuss this again tomorrow, but I don't think I'll take your personal documents with.

2019/11/22, 17:20 - Sechaba: Cool. Thank you for explaining. I'm happy to take the other stuff, but I'm not comfortable taking your personal documents. 

Why do you need to send them to Joburg?
2019/11/23, 17:19 - Lungelo: Missed voice call
2019/11/23, 17:12 - Lungelo: If you are in town by any chance today or tomorrow let me know
2019/11/23, 17:12 - Lungelo: Where are you staying right now?
2019/11/23, 17:20 - Lungelo: Let me know when you'll be in the vicinity and I'll revert back to you.
2019/11/23, 17:25 - Lungelo: And what's your capacity? How much space do you have?
2019/11/23, 17:25 - Lungelo: I want to give you 2 brown bags (all essentially NOT hand luggage) with curtains, cutlery and a kettle...
2019/11/23, 17:26 - Lungelo: Instead of just the curtains
2019/11/23, 17:26 - Sechaba: I'm at Peter's house. Close to the high school.
2019/11/23, 17:26 - Sechaba: It needs to be something I can carry easily.
2019/11/23, 17:27 - Sechaba: Probably have about 7kgs to work with.
2019/11/23, 17:27 - Lungelo: .
2019/11/23, 17:28 - Lungelo: It should be fine. If its too much then you can always leave it and I'll ship it with the rest... just don't know when Ntokozo will give me the stuff though next year...
2019/11/24, 12:35 - Lungelo: Missed voice call
2019/11/24, 12:45 - Sechaba: What's up?
2019/11/24, 12:46 - Lungelo: Wanted to ask if I can drop off the stuff in the next 30 minutes
2019/11/24, 12:46 - Lungelo: And to please send me the address
2019/11/24, 12:59 - Lungelo: ...
2019/11/24, 13:08 - Sechaba: I'm on the move. I thought I'd find you at church. I'm currently at wakaberry.
2019/11/24, 13:08 - Lungelo: Would you be able to take the stuff coz I can bring it to wakaberry or wherever you are in town
2019/11/24, 13:18 - Sechaba: Yes. You can come to wakaberry.
2019/11/24, 13:19 - Lungelo: I'll be there in 10 minutes
2019/11/24, 16:54 - Lungelo: The curtains are for the sliding door. Both of them. I couldn't find the curtain hooks as well as the hooks that go into the rail, so I ask you to please buy 5 packs of each from Pep. It shouldn't be more than R50.

Those hooks will be for the kitchen curtains, and for the balcony...
2019/11/25, 22:42 - Lungelo: How was the traveling with everything?
2019/11/26, 07:56 - Sechaba: Not too bad. That bag is really handy.
2019/11/26, 08:00 - Sechaba: I've just had a look at the financial arrangement you drew up. Everything looks fine except I can't yet say how the installments will look like. Maybe we can have it that half is paid by 28 Jan and the rest is paid by 28 Feb.
2019/11/26, 08:00 - Sechaba: My goal, however, will be to pay as soon as possible.
2019/11/26, 08:01 - Lungelo: ✌🏾
2019/11/26, 08:01 - Lungelo: ✌🏾
2019/11/26, 12:03 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/11/26, 12:22 - Sechaba: I should be able to arrange something. Will confirm later tonight. Have you checked whether they can delay their delivery?
2019/11/26, 12:31 - Lungelo: Not takealot
2019/11/26, 12:31 - Lungelo: Just Macro
2019/11/26, 12:31 - Lungelo: But we would have to arrange with a specific store.
2019/11/26, 12:31 - Lungelo: They can't keep it for more than 3 weeks
2019/11/26, 12:33 - Sechaba: Cool. I'll just pick up the stuff from one of the pickup stores.
2019/11/26, 12:34 - Lungelo: I'm talking about Fridges and beds would you be able to
2019/11/26, 12:34 - Lungelo: ?
2019/11/26, 13:28 - Sechaba: Not fridges. The stuff you mentioned in the voice note.
2019/11/26, 13:31 - Lungelo: That will be delivered by takealot
2019/11/26, 13:31 - Lungelo: Just give me an address during office hours.
2019/11/26, 16:24 - Sechaba: I don't think you're understanding me. Takealot has a service where you can collect items instead of having them delivered to you. I will go collect all the items from a pickup store.

2019/11/27, 09:13 - Lungelo: I'm getting this fridge today
2019/11/27, 09:16 - Lungelo: Please reply ASAP as it's flying fast
2019/11/27, 09:26 - Sechaba: Is it better than the other fridge you showed me?
2019/11/27, 09:30 - Lungelo: Its bigger
2019/11/27, 09:30 - Lungelo: By 100 Litres
2019/11/27, 09:31 - Lungelo: KIC is a known fridge brand that has been around for many years so I'm not phased by the brand
2019/11/27, 09:31 - Sechaba: Cool. Go ahead👍🏽
2019/11/27, 09:31 - Lungelo: I'm putting your details down on the order?
2019/11/27, 09:32 - Sechaba: Which details?
2019/11/27, 09:32 - Lungelo: Name and  cellphone number
2019/11/27, 09:32 - Lungelo: The delivery address is Eden Sandton
2019/11/27, 09:33 - Sechaba: Oh ok cool. And it is being delivered in Jan right?
2019/11/27, 09:34 - Lungelo: I'm trying to get that organised
2019/11/27, 09:35 - Sechaba: Cool. Thanks.
2019/11/27, 09:39 - Lungelo: ✅fridge
2019/11/27, 09:42 - Sechaba: I've lost the excel sheet🙈
2019/11/27, 09:47 - Lungelo: Refresh
2019/11/27, 09:47 - Lungelo: Property rentals 2019
2019/11/27, 09:47 - Sechaba: What?
2019/11/27, 09:48 - Lungelo: The Google drive
2019/11/27, 09:48 - Lungelo: This is the folder it's under
2019/11/27, 09:49 - Sechaba: Still can't find it.
2019/11/27, 09:49 - Sechaba: Oh wait, there it is!
2019/11/27, 09:49 - Sechaba: Thanks.
2019/11/27, 09:53 - Sechaba: You need to add the cost of the stuff I had to travel with.
2019/11/27, 09:53 - Lungelo: I will.
2019/11/27, 09:54 - Lungelo: I already did
2019/11/27, 09:54 - Sechaba: 👍🏽
2019/11/27, 10:32 - Sechaba: I am not making progress with my credit card application so I'll just have to work off the salary. I will send you 6000 later today. 4000 can be for the microwave, pots, and bin. And 2000 towards the deposit. If all goes well, another 3000 in Dec for deposit and another 3000 in Jan before paying you off in Feb.
2019/11/27, 23:55 - Lungelo: First R10 750 paid
2019/11/27, 23:55 - Lungelo: Will pay the other one tomorrow
2019/11/27, 23:56 - Lungelo: In respect of this 

LM NGOBESE

FNB
2019/11/28, 00:15 - Lungelo: Please rather buy the microwave and the bin coz that money might take too long to clear between FNB and Standard Bank... I haven't decided on a microwave or anything... there are a few big bins in my cart... pots are a bit of a situation I need to talk to my mom about coz these shops sell the non-stick sets and that scratches waaaaaay too easily.

2019/11/28, 01:01 - Lungelo: An option
2019/11/28, 08:10 - Sechaba: You don't have to pay the other amount until the end of December. But if you want to pay it now, do you mind waiting a couple of days until the money I send you clears? 

I think it makes sense for you to buy everything since:
1. You already have the items in your basket
2. You have a stronger preference for the items we should buy first and last
3. Most importantly, you can decide how much cash you need (as part of my flat cover) and how much can go to expenditure from the money I send you.
2019/11/28, 09:48 - Lungelo: I'll be in the rural areas with limited access to stuff... So I want to do it while I can to tick stuff off the list.
2019/11/28, 09:48 - Lungelo: Okay cool
2019/11/28, 09:50 - Sechaba: Thank you🙌🏽
2019/11/28, 14:15 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/11/28, 14:15 - Lungelo: Can't buy online

2019/11/28, 22:23 - Sechaba: Do we need a mirror?
2019/11/29, 00:56 - Lungelo: Later on in Dec yes I think it's important
2019/11/29, 01:25 - Lungelo: Does the flat already have a gas bottle fitted in or do we need to but one for the first month... for the stove?

2019/11/29, 07:20 - Lungelo: Which one do you want?
2019/11/29, 08:14 - Sechaba: We do need to buy one at the start yes. But it lasts longer than a month.
2019/11/29, 08:14 - Sechaba: Can we get the mirror later?
2019/11/29, 08:15 - Sechaba: We can decide where it should go and where it should be placed?
2019/11/29, 08:17 - Sechaba: ☝🏾

2019/11/29, 10:30 - Lungelo: So I'm going to spend R2023 on 

1. Microwave 
2. 9kg gas bottle 
3. Clothes dryer 
4. Bin
2019/11/29, 10:30 - Lungelo: Is that cool?
2019/11/29, 10:36 - Sechaba: I think we can wait before buying the gas bottle. We need to make sure we are buying the right size.
2019/11/29, 10:36 - Sechaba: Or maybe just confirm with Charlene or Jayson first.
2019/11/29, 10:37 - Sechaba: Everything is else is fine.
2019/11/29, 10:37 - Lungelo: Gas bottles have the same nose. The size is essentially how long it will last
2019/11/29, 10:37 - Lungelo: Please ask them
2019/11/29, 10:49 - Sechaba: Not the nose. The bottle goes into a cupboard that is a certain size.
2019/11/29, 10:50 - Lungelo: Okay cool. Let me know what they say
2019/11/29, 10:51 - Lungelo: Its R300 off which is a lot for a 9kg bottle
2019/11/29, 10:57 - Sechaba: I prefer to wait and buy the gas later. We already have so many things that we are buying.
2019/11/29, 10:58 - Sechaba: Could you please also sign the financial agreement form and send it to me?
2019/11/29, 11:00 - Lungelo: Then what do you think we should be buying now so we can get that out of the way
2019/11/29, 11:00 - Lungelo: It's printed. Will get to it
2019/11/29, 11:01 - Sechaba: If we have the essentials, we can buy the other stuff later.
2019/11/29, 11:33 - Lungelo: In a meeting
2019/11/29, 11:34 - Sechaba: Makro wants to deliver the fridge tomorrow.
2019/11/29, 11:35 - Lungelo: Please give the number of the person who called you
2019/11/29, 11:35 - Lungelo: What did you say?
2019/11/29, 11:35 - Sechaba: 010 271 1750
2019/11/29, 11:50 - Lungelo: Sorted
2019/11/29, 11:50 - Sechaba: What's happening?
2019/11/29, 11:50 - Lungelo: 1st week of Jan
2019/11/29, 11:50 - Sechaba: Ok cool. Thanks.
2019/11/29, 11:51 - Lungelo: I'm going to call you now
2019/11/29, 11:51 - Lungelo: Is that fine
2019/11/29, 11:51 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2019/11/29, 12:09 - Sechaba: Do we pay extra for this Takealot locker?
2019/11/29, 12:10 - Lungelo: Not that I'm aware of
2019/11/29, 12:10 - Lungelo: There's one in Rivonia
2019/11/29, 12:15 - Sechaba: Perfect.
2019/11/29, 13:28 - Lungelo: I sent you the invoice from takealot. Those are the things that belong to you essentially. If you want anything else purchased speak now or forever hold your peace.
2019/11/29, 13:40 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2019/11/29, 13:47 - Lungelo: You have until 14h30 to decide if we should get anything more
2019/11/29, 17:03 - Sechaba: Do we have pots?
2019/11/29, 17:21 - Lungelo: Haven't found
2019/11/29, 17:24 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/11/29, 19:10 - Lungelo: Doubt it
2019/11/30, 00:36 - Lungelo: https://www.takealot.com/berlinger-haus-12-2-pieces-marble-coating-cookware-set-moonlight/PLID54852724/reviews/1

This is apparently really good but its marble coating which means extra care always. They are 63% off...
2019/11/30, 09:39 - Sechaba: What do you mean by 'extra care'?
2019/11/30, 09:40 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/11/30, 09:42 - Sechaba: You think we should get it?
2019/11/30, 10:41 - Sechaba: Have you purchased all the other items from takealot?
2019/11/30, 12:38 - Lungelo: The other items are actually more for me at the moment... the only other communal thing is the carpet that I'm waiting to go on sale...
2019/11/30, 12:39 - Lungelo: Yes. I think they're a good option... If you don't mind owning potentially rose gold marble pots... otherwise we can look for something stainless steel but I won't be non-stick like the maybe ones
2019/11/30, 14:40 - Sechaba: We can get them🙌🏽
2019/11/30, 16:03 - Lungelo: https://tkop.org/2019/10/07/predict-miss-universe-2019-vote/?fbclid=IwAR0Tz-eZUm43XpxOZo5IdwgSeXPK4xHl6aZYmdA9dFGwdgYcgp_EUtnvzFc
2019/12/01, 00:37 - Lungelo: At the moment the cheapest they are is R2500 for a 15 piece set. Let's see what Cyber Monday brings. 

Let me know about the gas bottle size then that should round it up. 

Currently the balance is R4586 (R6 000 - R1414). 

Washing machine is the last big expense we'd need in that week already  OR plastic containers to handwash...
2019/12/01, 10:09 - Lungelo: https://m.takealot.com/berlinger-haus-15-piece-marble-coating-cookware-set-aquamarine-e/PLID52492357
2019/12/02, 11:21 - Sechaba: How do you confirm if the gas bottle already has gas? Because I am seeing similarly priced gas bottles at Makro.
2019/12/02, 11:35 - Lungelo: They won't sell an empty bottle to you
2019/12/02, 11:35 - Lungelo: You trade in an empty bottle for a refill. So when you buy it initially you get it with gas in it
2019/12/02, 11:36 - Lungelo: We have gas stove at home
2019/12/02, 11:41 - Sechaba: Ok cool. The Cadac 9kg seems more legit and it only costs R10 more.
2019/12/02, 11:41 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/12/02, 11:41 - Lungelo: I'd rather take Takealot
2019/12/02, 11:41 - Lungelo: Coz they have the pickup thing
2019/12/02, 11:41 - Sechaba: What?
2019/12/02, 11:42 - Sechaba: This is from Takealot
2019/12/02, 11:42 - Lungelo: The gas bottle there
2019/12/02, 11:42 - Lungelo: Okay I'll buy it now
2019/12/02, 11:42 - Sechaba: Same thing. Just Megamaster vs Cadac.
2019/12/02, 11:42 - Lungelo: Ok
2019/12/02, 11:43 - Sechaba: Just confirming with Charlene quickly.
2019/12/02, 11:43 - Sechaba: *that it will fit in the cupboard.
2019/12/02, 11:50 - Sechaba: She recommends the Afrox one.
2019/12/02, 11:52 - Sechaba: I think we can still get the Cadac one. The size of the Afrox and Cadac are similar.
2019/12/02, 11:53 - Lungelo: It's suppose to be the same size. 9kg. Not similar.
2019/12/02, 11:54 - Lungelo: So cadac?
2019/12/02, 11:56 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/12/02, 12:43 - Lungelo: Will you get it then?
2019/12/02, 12:44 - Lungelo: I'll send the cash
2019/12/02, 12:44 - Lungelo: I prefer this one too coz you swop out the bottle each time instead of refilling
2019/12/02, 12:56 - Sechaba: Yeah, you can send the money. I'll probably buy in Jan though.
2019/12/02, 17:40 - Lungelo: It won't be on special anymore then
2019/12/02, 17:40 - Lungelo: But whatever
2019/12/02, 17:40 - Lungelo: Please send me your banking details
2019/12/02, 17:47 - Sechaba: Name of account: Mr Sechaba Mokobane

Account number: 072997524

Bank: Standard Bank

Branch code: 051001
2019/12/02, 17:48 - Lungelo: ✌🏽
2019/12/02, 17:48 - Lungelo: I'll send R600
2019/12/02, 17:48 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2019/12/02, 17:49 - Sechaba: Please update the Excel sheet afterwards.
2019/12/02, 17:50 - Lungelo: I'm marking. So nowhere near laptop.  Don't you have internet at work?
2019/12/02, 18:28 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/12/02, 19:01 - Sechaba: Yeah. I can update.
2019/12/03, 08:02 - Sechaba: Can you make the excel sheet reflect how much I've paid towards the deposit and rent, and how much I still owe?
2019/12/03, 08:07 - Lungelo: Morning. I'll see what I can do.
2019/12/05, 20:00 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>

2019/12/05, 20:05 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/12/06, 10:07 - Sechaba: I'll see if I can collect the items from takealot. Please remember that I am staying in an Airbnb in Pretoria so it's difficult to keep a clothes horse, a bin, and a microwave in my room along with all the other stuff I have. Plus, I don't think it's good manners to just use the room as a storage facility even if it does fit.
2019/12/06, 10:07 - Sechaba: I think the price of the pots is too steep. We can try again in Jan.
2019/12/06, 10:08 - Sechaba: Is this how much is going towards the rent? Have you accunted for the 600 you gave me?
2019/12/06, 10:09 - Sechaba: Please make sure the fridge is delivered on the weekend.
2019/12/08, 14:51 - Sechaba: I think we should actually buy the pot set. I'll organise to collect it along with the other stuff on Takealot this week.
2019/12/08, 18:40 - Lungelo: Are you sure? What colour? Check takealot for options and let me know
2019/12/08, 18:46 - Sechaba: Yes🙌🏽 I'm not sure what it's called, but I like the black.
2019/12/08, 18:50 - Lungelo: Ok

2019/12/08, 19:22 - Sechaba: Thanks🙌🏽
2019/12/08, 19:34 - Lungelo: Purchased. The email is in my outbox to you.
2019/12/08, 19:38 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/12/08, 19:40 - Lungelo: There are 3 options here, 

If everything goes swimmingly and I do have extra cash end of Dec I can use this plus the extra cash to get a washing machine... We should be done then for the rest of the month... 

Or that R1474 could go towards the deposit as agreed

Or that R1474 could go towards other small items that we might need...
2019/12/08, 20:03 - Sechaba: Thank you!🙌🏽
2019/12/08, 20:03 - Sechaba: I'm happy for you to do whatever makes sense.
2019/12/08, 20:06 - Lungelo: Washing machine. 

I'd rather sell it to you when you have the cash next year but we'll get it in the first week coz stuff needs to be washed. Ain't nobody got time for handwash
2019/12/08, 20:09 - Sechaba: Cool🙌🏽
2019/12/08, 20:55 - Sechaba: Should we also try to set up the wifi as well? Or that can be done later?
2019/12/08, 22:01 - Sechaba: And sorry, I didn't realise you had already specified the pick up point. Could you please ask them to have the stuff ready at the pick up point in Hatfield.
2019/12/08, 22:11 - Lungelo: One can't call them. I've tried. Do you know anyone that'll be in the Sandton vicinity to just pick it all up rather on your behalf...
2019/12/08, 22:12 - Lungelo: We can try... but I'm not familiar with what's available and what you want so... you can go for it when you're ready. We'll probs have to buy a router though
2019/12/08, 22:13 - Sechaba: 👌🏾
2019/12/08, 22:14 - Sechaba: I don't know anyone that can collect by the 13th.
2019/12/08, 22:15 - Sechaba: Are the pots also set for Sandton?
2019/12/08, 22:17 - Lungelo: Yes
2019/12/08, 22:18 - Sechaba: Have you tried downloading their app and doing it there?
2019/12/08, 22:23 - Lungelo: The app is the same as the online platform pretty much. There's nothing in there about changing locations. Online they say you can't change locations once order is confirmed. Neither can you change from collection o delivery.
2019/12/08, 22:23 - Lungelo: It's weird. I know.
2019/12/08, 22:27 - Sechaba: So we're screwed?
2019/12/08, 22:27 - Sechaba: What happens if you cancel and do it again?
2019/12/08, 22:27 - Lungelo: The orders will just lapse and we'll get a refund
2019/12/08, 22:27 - Lungelo: But obviously different prices coz we got the stuff on black Friday
2019/12/08, 22:28 - Lungelo: If collection doesn't happen in 7 Days
2019/12/08, 22:31 - Sechaba: Why did you select Sandton?
2019/12/08, 22:33 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/12/08, 22:34 - Sechaba: Ah, that makes sense. I'll try see if I can't make a plan.
2019/12/08, 23:24 - Lungelo: Cool
2019/12/09, 21:47 - Sechaba: Did you manage to pay both sets of monies for the apartment? Because it might make sense to start moving some of the stuff into our apartment.
2019/12/09, 21:48 - Lungelo: We only get the keys on 1 Jan. Otherwise we must pay pro-rata for each day we move in early
2019/12/09, 21:49 - Lungelo: I will. Just need to sort out my flight situation. I'll do it by next week Friday. The money is in my savings account so it's ready, but might need to sort out some more pressing personal matters first then I can always top up when I get paid next week
2019/12/09, 21:50 - Sechaba: Cool. Thanks.
2019/12/10, 09:11 - Lungelo: Insurance of R295 a month on all of the flat's contents plus my Mac book
2019/12/10, 09:11 - Lungelo: In total
2019/12/10, 12:10 - Sechaba: So this is furniture + appliances+ Mac book excluding other electronics?
2019/12/10, 19:00 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/12/10, 19:32 - Sechaba: Would I be able to add my laptop?
2019/12/10, 19:33 - Lungelo: Yes. But the premium will go up obviously
2019/12/10, 19:33 - Lungelo: Depends on the cover value
2019/12/10, 19:34 - Lungelo: I insured book value coz my Mac is worth 12k now
2019/12/10, 19:39 - Sechaba: Ok cool👍🏾
2019/12/11, 00:27 - Lungelo: I see you collected the orders today! Thanks so much! A few things out of the way.
2019/12/11, 07:29 - Sechaba: Yes. We have found the pots.
2019/12/11, 08:07 - Lungelo: 🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂🤦🏾‍♂😅😅😅
2019/12/12, 17:07 - Sechaba: Do I give Charlene this number or the other one?
2019/12/12, 17:07 - Sechaba: Lungelo.vcf (file attached)
2019/12/12, 17:13 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/12/12, 17:14 - Sechaba: I hope that was the correct one. We've been added to the system.
2019/12/12, 17:23 - Lungelo: Both if you can
2019/12/12, 17:24 - Lungelo: OK cool
2019/12/12, 17:24 - Lungelo: My initials are LMN not Lun😔
2019/12/13, 14:41 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2019/12/13, 15:12 - Sechaba: Amazing! Thank you🙌🏽
2019/12/14, 21:18 - Lungelo: Enjoy the wedding!
2019/12/14, 21:24 - Sechaba: You're not coming?😐
2019/12/14, 21:24 - Lungelo: Sadly not. I'm at home already
2019/12/14, 21:25 - Sechaba: Ah, I was really looking to seeing you there.
2019/12/14, 21:25 - Lungelo: That's one of the things I had to sort out lol. Can't be easy breaking that to the groom a week before his wedding 🤦🏽‍♂
2019/12/14, 21:25 - Lungelo: Lol you'll see me first week of January
2019/12/14, 21:26 - Sechaba: 😔😔
2019/12/14, 21:26 - Sechaba: I guess. I hope you enjoy your time at home!🙌🏽
2019/12/14, 21:28 - Lungelo: Will do. Hope you enjoy the wedding as well. Take lots of pics!
2019/12/14, 22:29 - Sechaba: Thank you🙌🏽

2019/12/17, 19:28 - Lungelo: BIG IF
2019/12/17, 19:29 - Lungelo: I can't find a decent grey or silver washing machine to match the fridge 🥺🥺🥺
2019/12/17, 20:19 - Sechaba: What do you mean by 'decent'?
2019/12/17, 20:19 - Lungelo: Doesn't have bad reviews
2019/12/17, 20:20 - Lungelo: And potentially 7kg not 6
2019/12/17, 20:23 - Sechaba: Ah, thats a problem.
2019/12/17, 20:24 - Lungelo: Yeah
2019/12/17, 20:24 - Lungelo: Anyway how was the wedding?
2019/12/17, 22:48 - Lungelo: https://www.makro.co.za/appliances/washers-tumble-dryers/washing-machines/front-load-washers/aeg-7kg-front-load-washer-silver/p/000000000000313733_EA?gclid=CjwKCAiAluLvBRASEiwAAbX3GfZJAAyACCLchk-9wnlUoM5l_7dMtr0G8hqlNo2CZUB5Kbj1Kbwp7RoCXyoQAvD_BwE
2019/12/17, 22:49 - Lungelo: I think we have a winner...
2019/12/17, 22:49 - Lungelo: Please also give your suggestions 🙌🏾
2019/12/18, 20:42 - Sechaba: When do you want to buy it?
2019/12/18, 20:43 - Sechaba: Wedding was amazing! Matthew has made the right choice.
2019/12/18, 20:43 - Lungelo: On the 24th of Dec
2019/12/18, 20:44 - Lungelo: Lol and you only realize that now
2019/12/18, 20:44 - Lungelo: I'm glad you enjoyed it 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
2019/12/18, 20:44 - Lungelo: But that's a big IF. I haven't decided yet.
2019/12/19, 01:48 - Lungelo: Please let me know how much you want to insure you laptop for and what brand it is. I'd personally insure it for book value and not replacement value coz then your premium will skyrocket. But it's up to you.
2019/12/19, 01:51 - Lungelo: Then second last thing: internet. I know it's way too early still but have you spoken to the providers etc
2019/12/19, 01:55 - Lungelo: Last thing: room selection

Then with your cash on me, I was thinking:

1. Cleaning supplies coz the flat is probs dusty
2. Plates etc
3. Electricity units
4. Kitchen curtains
5. Other
2019/12/20, 22:05 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/12/20, 22:39 - Lungelo: We already have crockery🙌🏾
2019/12/20, 22:40 - Lungelo: Okay cool
2019/12/20, 22:40 - Lungelo: Room selection
2019/12/20, 22:41 - Lungelo: Lekker internship🔥
2019/12/20, 23:35 - Sechaba: What about room selection?
2019/12/20, 23:54 - Lungelo: Youre moving in before me so we need to kind of decide who gets which room even though they are the same size
2019/12/20, 23:57 - Lungelo: I.e. I'd prefer the room behind the living room type thing
2019/12/21, 00:39 - Sechaba: Is this what you want?
2019/12/21, 07:29 - Lungelo: A preference. Hence I asked that we should maybe talk about it in case there are conflicting preferences.
2019/12/21, 08:17 - Sechaba: I was planning on choosing on the day. I'll describe the two rooms when I get there and we can decide then.
2019/12/21, 08:42 - Lungelo: Okay. But the layout of the pics online looks pretty standard... Thats what I concluded with. But we'll wait for when you move in
2019/12/21, 15:21 - Sechaba: Is this a noise thing?
2019/12/21, 15:32 - Lungelo: Uhmmm not really just a preference
2019/12/21, 15:46 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/12/21, 16:02 - Lungelo: There arent any curtain rails 😱😱😱😱
2019/12/21, 16:07 - Lungelo: 2 questions: if the rent were to be adjusted how much will it be

Which one would you prefer
2019/12/21, 16:23 - Lungelo: Tbh it would be nice to have the living room one but I can't afford to pay more than what I'm paying given my other expenses so on that basis I'll take the smaller one if the price is substantially different✌🏽
2019/12/21, 16:23 - Lungelo: I just sent this coz I had already typed it

2019/12/21, 18:11 - Lungelo: Missed voice call
2019/12/21, 17:19 - Lungelo: ???
2019/12/21, 18:13 - Lungelo: This message was deleted
2019/12/21, 18:14 - Lungelo: Ill take the one with the one extra cupboard for R5200
2019/12/21, 18:17 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/12/21, 18:21 - Lungelo: R5300
2019/12/21, 18:29 - Sechaba: 5350.
2019/12/21, 18:29 - Lungelo: R5400 is my final offer
2019/12/21, 18:32 - Sechaba: I'm out. It's yours.
2019/12/21, 18:41 - Lungelo: This message was deleted
2019/12/21, 20:32 - Lungelo: What time are you maybe available to have a chat for tomorrow?
2019/12/21, 20:35 - Lungelo: But it must be before you settle in essentially
2019/12/21, 20:38 - Sechaba: You want to chat tomorrow?
2019/12/21, 20:39 - Lungelo: Yes
2019/12/21, 20:39 - Sechaba: You can try at around 2.
2019/12/21, 20:39 - Sechaba: Just message me beforehand.
2019/12/21, 20:40 - Lungelo: Ok

2019/12/22, 19:24 - Lungelo: Lol if you had moved in without consultation then it would have been an awkward year so thank you for letting me know.

In terms of the Sandton central area point, I'm saying that paying more would have been more up for debate because it would have been closer... If you get what I mean... That's what I meant.

When we searched initially yes I wasn't sure we'd get something close at an affordable rate but when I compiled the top 6 places to view I chose the ones that were as close as possible to work or were somewhat cheaper but a bit far.

I'm not dissatisfied with the place please don't get me wrong, it was just a point of consideration, which has been considered.

I was not bringing up the arrangement thing to be spiteful or anything, was a point of consideration which was considered.

The research thing wasn't communicated as being extensive, only that it was urgent... So I assumed you had capacity around that time to sort out the situation in your breaks/spare time etc.

It's a negotiation lol.  Which was done under tight deadline pressure. I unfortunately don't accept the bad faith remark but I appreciate you bringing it up.
2019/12/22, 19:26 - Lungelo: I think we should use tonight to think of alternative offers.

One of my alternatives, in the first year anyway, was  for me to revoke my final bid of R5400.
2019/12/22, 19:30 - Lungelo: Also, this alternative is not feasible for the next few months because according to the contract, we must give advance notice, like 2 months, and we must find alternative tenants. That, unfortunately also indicates a little bit of bad faith in that the contract was not entered into whole-heartedly and whole mindedly🤭🙃
2019/12/22, 19:37 - Sechaba: And for you to get the room with the view?
2019/12/22, 19:40 - Sechaba: Because it now seems as if this was something we needed to resolve together,  but now after consideration, it is completely my fault and should be punished.
2019/12/22, 19:44 - Sechaba: I think the person that gets the room should pay an amount equal to their first bid. In other words, if you take it you need to pay 5200 and if I take it then I'll pay 5250.
2019/12/22, 19:44 - Lungelo: My argument is that because it's short notice and as it is a contentious factor that resulted from an oversight on your part,  it should be a considered factor coz now its throwing everything off at the last minute
2019/12/22, 19:45 - Lungelo: I will think about this and get back to you ✌🏽🙌🏾
2019/12/22, 19:45 - Sechaba: Cool☝🏾
2019/12/30, 13:39 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo. I move in tomorrow so please could you let me know what you've decided by the end of the day.
2019/12/30, 14:27 - Lungelo: Hey. You can have the room
2019/12/30, 15:27 - Sechaba: How come?
2019/12/30, 18:00 - Lungelo: Just
2019/12/30, 18:07 - Sechaba: Ah ah, please speak.
2019/12/30, 18:07 - Lungelo: There's no reason lol. I thought about it and that was the conclusion 🤷🏽‍♂
2019/12/30, 19:31 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2019/12/30, 19:35 - Lungelo: Lmao I didn't record his pitch
2019/12/30, 19:36 - Lungelo: I had to take Discovery so I chose classic saver.
2019/12/30, 19:36 - Lungelo: So it's 200% of the discovery rate hospital cover that covers 95% of the time.
2019/12/30, 19:39 - Sechaba: What does this mean?
2019/12/30, 19:40 - Lungelo: You can choose classic smart as well, without the saver, but you won't have day to day benefits. So it's cheaper but you must have savings in place
2019/12/30, 19:42 - Lungelo: You'll probably be covered most of the time. That's what it means. They ordinarily cover people 95% of the time. So the chances of you being covered in full are very high.
2019/12/30, 19:45 - Lungelo: If you can choose something else other than Discovery, do so. Have a look at Fedhealth, SpectraMed and MedShield
2019/12/30, 19:45 - Sechaba: Why do you say this?
2019/12/30, 19:46 - Lungelo: It's not the greatest medical aid out there but it's also not the worst... You need to keep your finger on the pulse with the benefits that they offer coz you might be bummed if they say xyz is not covered
2019/12/30, 19:53 - Sechaba: How much are you paying?
2019/12/30, 20:02 - Lungelo: R2600
2019/12/30, 20:03 - Lungelo: So I'll take the saver for a year until I have decent savings then downgrade to classic smart which is R1980
2019/12/30, 21:44 - Sechaba: Oh oh cool. I might ask some more questions later.
2019/12/30, 22:50 - Lungelo: Ok
2019/12/31, 10:38 - Lungelo: ?
2019/12/31, 12:26 - Sechaba: I'm really sorry, but I think we're going to have to try Friday or next week some time. I'm running behind schedule and I can't yet say when we'll get to the flat.
2019/12/31, 19:07 - Sechaba: Only got to the place 30 minutes ago. I'm not sure if that would have worked out.
2020/01/02, 21:04 - Lungelo: How was work?
2020/01/02, 22:02 - Sechaba: Chilled. Some admin and then some games in the afternoon.
2020/01/02, 22:03 - Lungelo: Ah nice!
2020/01/02, 22:03 - Lungelo: Did the people come to fit in curtain rails and a burglar bar on the door?
2020/01/02, 22:03 - Lungelo: Hope you enjoyed it
2020/01/02, 22:04 - Lungelo: And how's Eden? No ghosts?
2020/01/02, 22:32 - Sechaba: We're not getting a burglar bar. But Charlene is working on the curtain rails.
2020/01/02, 22:32 - Sechaba: Not yet.
2020/01/02, 22:33 - Lungelo: Hebana why not
2020/01/02, 22:33 - Lungelo: Are there 2 sets of keys hey?
2020/01/02, 22:34 - Lungelo: Whew😅
2020/01/03, 07:06 - Sechaba: Nobody gets those
2020/01/03, 07:06 - Sechaba: Yeah.
2020/01/03, 08:00 - Lungelo: 🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂
2020/01/03, 08:01 - Lungelo: Cool
2020/01/03, 12:06 - Lungelo: I think we should get a washing machine.🙈
2020/01/03, 12:11 - Lungelo: https://www.makro.co.za/appliances/washers-tumble-dryers/washing-machines/front-load-washers/aeg-7kg-front-load-washer-silver/p/000000000000313733_EA
2020/01/03, 12:11 - Lungelo: This one
2020/01/03, 21:35 - Sechaba: Can we discuss this once you arrive.
2020/01/03, 21:35 - Sechaba: *?
2020/01/03, 21:38 - Lungelo: Ok
2020/01/03, 21:39 - Lungelo: May I ask why
2020/01/03, 22:28 - Sechaba: You'll see when you get here.
2020/01/03, 22:28 - Sechaba: When do you arrive?
2020/01/04, 08:03 - Lungelo: Morning, just a heads up that my bed is coming today.

Did the fridge come yet?
2020/01/04, 08:04 - Lungelo: I'll be at the flat around 21h30 ish
2020/01/04, 08:04 - Lungelo: Tomorrow
2020/01/04, 08:41 - Sechaba: What time? I have plans today.
2020/01/04, 08:41 - Sechaba: No.
2020/01/04, 08:49 - Sechaba: Make sure it gets here before 12.
2020/01/04, 08:49 - Sechaba: Or tomorrow.
2020/01/04, 08:53 - Lungelo: I don't know. The delivery people just call. I'll find out.
2020/01/04, 10:49 - Lungelo: When will you be back
2020/01/04, 10:49 - Lungelo: I can only try. With deliveries in South Africa it doesn't work like that.
2020/01/04, 10:53 - Lungelo: The guy isn't giving me a clear time.
2020/01/04, 11:08 - Sechaba: I'm not sure. Can you ask him to tell you when he is 30 mins away and I'll make a plan to come back.
2020/01/04, 11:08 - Lungelo: Will do.
2020/01/04, 11:20 - Lungelo: This message was deleted
2020/01/04, 11:20 - Lungelo: Thank you
2020/01/05, 10:20 - Lungelo: Hey what's up
2020/01/05, 10:20 - Lungelo: Got your missed calls.
2020/01/05, 10:20 - Lungelo: Am in church
2020/01/05, 12:00 - Sechaba: Still in church?
2020/01/05, 12:15 - Lungelo: No I'm free
2020/01/05, 12:20 - Lungelo: I don't know what's going on. Maybe please send a VN
2020/01/06, 13:56 - Sechaba: I did not catch the name, but I was contacted by the following number: 074 770 8440.
2020/01/06, 13:57 - Sechaba: Could you please call the following number regarding the lights?
2020/01/06, 15:53 - Lungelo: Not picking yo
2020/01/06, 15:53 - Lungelo: Up
2020/01/06, 15:56 - Lungelo: I've called like 5 times already
2020/01/06, 16:17 - Lungelo: This shower pressure is *nonsense*
2020/01/06, 16:18 - Lungelo: When did the electrician call you
2020/01/06, 16:18 - Lungelo: Still nothing. Just rings.
2020/01/06, 16:31 - Lungelo: If you can, please bring me a keyring or keyholder. Preferably with a lanyard 🙈
2020/01/06, 22:14 - Sechaba: Charlene.vcf (file attached)
2020/01/07, 07:42 - Lungelo: Morning. Hope you are well. 

Not sure if Sechaba informed you but my brother was murdered outside my house 3 weeks ago. So I’m currently not at work. 

However please can you call Arrie and arrange when the electrician can come to the unit.

Thank you.

2020/01/11, 13:32 - Lungelo: Hi. May I please use the rack I want to hang my clothes.
2020/01/11, 15:06 - Lungelo: Nvm

2020/01/11, 16:03 - Sechaba: I'll be back tomorrow morning and I'll go get the gas from Makro/Builder's. Can we go have a look at washing machines as well?
2020/01/11, 16:09 - Sechaba: Sorry about that. It's in my bathroom. I should have put in on the balcony. If you still need it, please feel free to take it.
2020/01/11, 16:13 - Lungelo: OK.

I already ordered one on Thursday. 6kg Defy. That's the only one that will fit as it's the smallest one. It's white.

2020/01/11, 16:16 - Sechaba: Great, thanks!
2020/01/14, 09:47 - Lungelo: Long shot but are you able to be at home at like 15h00? Even if its for an hour window? These people want to deliver the washing machine today n we aren't allowed to have the security people collect our stuff apparently.
2020/01/14, 09:48 - Lungelo: Like the fridgr was a favour
2020/01/14, 10:08 - Sechaba: Unfortunately not🙈
2020/01/14, 10:12 - Lungelo: Ok
2020/01/17, 12:52 - Lungelo: You haven't gotten through to mweb hey?

2020/01/17, 17:49 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo. Are you home?

2020/01/18, 11:00 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. So sad good news and bad news. Good news: I managed to return the gas cylinder and get a cash refund. Bad news: Builder's has run out of Afrox 9kgs and I need to go back on Monday.

Good news pt 2: Afrox is much cheaper than Cadac and friends.
2020/01/18, 11:22 - Lungelo: Hi. Okay cool. Also. We might have to return the washing machine
2020/01/18, 11:22 - Lungelo: It came today and I did my laundry in it but the spin cycle😱😱😱

2020/01/18, 13:24 - Sechaba: Do you know where your mom bought her green bag?
2020/01/18, 13:25 - Lungelo: Not really
2020/01/18, 13:25 - Lungelo: I think it was those Avon booklets from a person selling or something.
2020/01/18, 13:25 - Lungelo: Why
2020/01/18, 13:26 - Sechaba: I want something similar.

2020/01/18, 13:26 - Lungelo: It's a cosmetics franchise
2020/01/18, 13:26 - Lungelo: Like Tupperware
2020/01/18, 13:27 - Sechaba: Thank you🙌🏽
2020/01/18, 13:27 - Lungelo: They have different brokers selling stuff so you speak to the broker and they buy it for you
2020/01/18, 13:36 - Sechaba: Cool. Thanks🙌🏽
2020/01/18, 16:10 - Lungelo: Do you have a small nut screw?

2020/01/18, 22:10 - Sechaba: Did you just receive a gate code?
2020/01/18, 22:15 - Lungelo: No
2020/01/19, 19:34 - Sechaba: Can I add this amount to the deposit balance? And then you can add the washing machine as your own item.
2020/01/19, 19:40 - Lungelo: I don't have this message you're referring to anymore. Changed phones remember.
2020/01/19, 19:40 - Lungelo: What amount
2020/01/19, 19:40 - Lungelo: I'll update the sheet when we get internet. Can't access Google platforms at work
2020/01/19, 19:43 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2020/01/19, 19:44 - Sechaba: Why don't you access it on your phone?
2020/01/19, 19:46 - Lungelo: Not lus
2020/01/19, 19:47 - Lungelo: What do you mean add to the deposit balance?
2020/01/19, 19:49 - Lungelo: I asked you earlier to please send me an "invoice" of all the expenses I need to reimburse you for.

So it's that R1414
R250 electricity 
R300 for the bed thing.

Minus the McDonald's meal which I think was R60?
2020/01/19, 19:50 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/01/19, 19:51 - Sechaba: I just added everything to the spreadsheet like we've been doing. We'll chat about it later.

2020/01/22, 17:41 - Lungelo: Hi. Why can't you get it today? You still studying or what
2020/01/22, 19:33 - Lungelo: We need matches or a lighter
2020/01/22, 22:34 - Sechaba: We had a social.
2020/01/22, 22:44 - Lungelo: Mama.vcf (file attached)
2020/01/22, 22:51 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2020/01/23, 19:39 - Lungelo: Eden Sandton: Temporary exit pin is 22900. Valid for 1 tries.
2020/01/24, 14:36 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo. The wifi guys are coming tomorrow between 9 and 10.

2020/01/24, 16:49 - Sechaba: I should have done that. I'll send him an SMS.
2020/01/24, 16:52 - Sechaba: Which number should I give him?
2020/01/24, 17:03 - Lungelo: Any
2020/01/25, 09:12 - Lungelo: Have the people contacted you yet
2020/01/25, 09:12 - Lungelo: Nobody here
2020/01/25, 09:31 - Lungelo: Please give me the details of the guy
2020/01/25, 09:33 - Lungelo: When you see this please talk to them and follow up. I'm going out at 11h30
2020/01/25, 09:55 - Lungelo: He came. There is no line here so MWeb must come to link it from the flat to the main line in 5 working days
2020/01/25, 09:56 - Lungelo: But there is a router now
2020/01/25, 11:08 - Sechaba: Perfect. Thank you🙌🏽
2020/01/25, 11:09 - Sechaba: Did he say he will contact mweb?
2020/01/25, 11:21 - Lungelo: Yes
2020/01/25, 11:22 - Lungelo: But I still think we should follow up sometime during the week
2020/01/25, 11:38 - Sechaba: 👌🏾
2020/01/28, 22:06 - Lungelo: Do you have suspender belts I can possibly borrow 👀
2020/01/28, 22:06 - Lungelo: For Friday
2020/01/28, 22:08 - Sechaba: No. Sorry.
2020/01/29, 12:24 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/01/29, 14:19 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2020/01/30, 11:09 - Sechaba: You deleted this message
2020/01/30, 11:33 - Lungelo: ?
2020/01/30, 11:34 - Sechaba: I've paid you 3606 = deposit + 60 (mcds) - 300 (matress)
2020/01/30, 11:35 - Sechaba: And then left the electricity on my side. So then next time you can buy 500 electricity.
2020/01/30, 11:38 - Lungelo: I'm a bit confused.
2020/01/30, 11:39 - Lungelo: Based on this it's meant to be R5 110
2020/01/30, 11:39 - Lungelo: Unless you're recouping your R1474 cash I had on me, which would then be R3636
2020/01/30, 11:40 - Lungelo: Ok
2020/01/30, 11:53 - Sechaba: 5250-1474+60-300?
2020/01/30, 12:04 - Lungelo: Please refer back to the agreement
2020/01/30, 12:04 - Lungelo: It's R5350
2020/01/30, 12:05 - Lungelo: Less all the other stuff
2020/01/30, 12:16 - Lungelo: We can talk about this when we see each other, but, how deposits work is that the deposit is proportionate to the rent that you are paying. Hence we went 50/50 on it at contract inception. So in my case it's meant to be R4750 + 750 for my 50% share of the registration. Thus R5 500 deposit alone. Further to that, since the deposit was paid together with the first months rent, I do think that a R250 re-imbursement for your portion is in order 👍🏾

Based on the above, you  can think about this to be sure, but of the R21 500 that was paid over, R11 250 is attribute to you.

So then the adjustments of amounts outstanding should be made on this, and not R10750 as previously determined.
2020/01/30, 12:18 - Sechaba: Sorry. I forgot about the registration amount.
2020/01/30, 12:22 - Sechaba: So it's 5250 + 750 - 1474 + 60 - 300?
2020/01/30, 12:40 - Lungelo: It's 11250 - 1474 + 60 - 300 =R9536 outstanding - R3 606 already paid = R5930 left over
2020/01/30, 12:56 - Sechaba: Perfect. I'll pay you the difference for the month and there'll be the 1 month rent outstanding.
2020/01/30, 17:21 - Lungelo: Just to confirm, the difference between R5930 and R5250. So R680?
2020/01/30, 17:54 - Sechaba: Yes. Paid already.
2020/01/30, 18:09 - Lungelo: Ok
2020/01/30, 19:40 - Lungelo: What time are you coming back. You left your keys at the door this morning
2020/01/30, 19:41 - Lungelo: And I'm really tired so might pass out
2020/01/30, 20:03 - Sechaba: Sorry about that🙈
2020/01/30, 20:03 - Sechaba: I was planning to come back around 22:30.
2020/01/30, 20:03 - Lungelo: Okay
2020/01/30, 20:04 - Sechaba: I think you can leave it unlocked if you fall asleep.
2020/01/30, 20:05 - Lungelo: If I fall asleep I'll be out like a light
2020/01/30, 20:06 - Lungelo: I'll leave it unlocked
2020/01/30, 20:10 - Sechaba: Thanks🙌🏾 Where will you leave the keys?
2020/01/30, 20:10 - Lungelo: On the microwave
2020/01/30, 20:11 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2020/01/30, 21:46 - Lungelo: I left your key on the fire extinguisher bottle (left) outside. The wind kept opening the door
2020/01/30, 22:23 - Sechaba: On my way home👌🏾
2020/01/30, 22:23 - Lungelo: .

2020/01/31, 21:18 - Lungelo: I have thanks
2020/02/01, 10:30 - Lungelo: What did the people say
2020/02/01, 11:24 - Sechaba: They said they will get back to me.
2020/02/01, 14:05 - Lungelo: 👍🏾
2020/02/02, 15:33 - Lungelo: Hi. May I please use your room chair for a bit. Nhla and Lolo are coming through later and there wont be enough seating

2020/02/02, 20:27 - Sechaba: Ah cool. Hope you had fun☝🏾
2020/02/03, 09:57 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo. Could you please follow up with the mweb people? I keep running out of airtime.
2020/02/03, 11:00 - Lungelo: I'm at induction now so I'm out of my rotation for 3 weeks.
2020/02/03, 11:00 - Lungelo: Don't you have a work phone?
2020/02/03, 11:57 - Sechaba: No. I don't have a work phone.

2020/02/09, 11:05 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo. Is it fine if we stick to using our own lunch boxes? We can obviously still share everything else as is.
2020/02/09, 11:09 - Lungelo: Hi. Why the change of heart?
2020/02/09, 11:22 - Sechaba: It's going to be simpler. Our choice of what to cook or pack for lunch won't be contingent on the lunchboxes available.

2020/02/24, 15:12 - Sechaba: Could you please use those.
2020/02/24, 15:17 - Lungelo: I'll try my best. They might not agree because it's not my information and it is technically unethical for me to pretend to be you in order to get the thing signed up, but I'll try.
2020/02/24, 15:52 - Sechaba: If that fails, could you please ask them to call me.
2020/02/24, 16:11 - Lungelo: They are following up.
2020/02/26, 21:08 - Lungelo: Hi
2020/02/26, 21:08 - Lungelo: I got the PMT thanks
2020/02/26, 21:09 - Lungelo: Did mweb call you?
2020/02/26, 21:09 - Lungelo: They are meant to come through. But they haven't confirmed yet. 🚮🚮🚮
2020/02/27, 05:17 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2020/02/27, 05:17 - Sechaba: They have not.
2020/02/27, 14:34 - Lungelo: I can't get through to them. If I can't get through to them by tomorrow at 12h00 we are getting Afrihost
2020/02/27, 14:35 - Lungelo: I've been calling the whole day and they just drop the call
2020/02/27, 14:35 - Lungelo: Even after I get through to a consultant.
2020/02/27, 15:08 - Sechaba: Yeah. We can try that. But if I remember correctly, Afrihost does not service our area.
2020/02/27, 15:08 - Lungelo: Or another provider
2020/02/27, 20:00 - Lungelo: Eden Sandton: Temporary exit pin is 79063. Valid for 1 tries.
2020/02/27, 20:01 - Sechaba: Thanks🙌🏾

2020/03/01, 20:08 - Lungelo: Infrastructure set up
2020/03/01, 20:08 - Lungelo: Try login online and see if you can't activate the service there?
2020/03/01, 20:08 - Lungelo: Using your mweb signup credentials
2020/03/02, 15:07 - Sechaba: I've been told you can just connect to the wifi and it should take you to a signup page. Did you try that?
2020/03/02, 15:07 - Sechaba: Sorry I couldnt respond earlier. Had an exam today.
2020/03/02, 15:17 - Lungelo: Yes
2020/03/02, 15:18 - Lungelo: Need to phone mweb to activate line
2020/03/02, 16:15 - Sechaba: I tried and ran out of airtime. Are you able to try them?
2020/03/02, 16:22 - Lungelo: Just phoned them
2020/03/02, 16:22 - Lungelo: The MetroFibre people must do the activation and let Mweb know.
2020/03/02, 16:45 - Lungelo: Are you at the flat?
2020/03/02, 16:46 - Lungelo: If you are, there's an SSD number below the black box that we need.
2020/03/02, 17:03 - Sechaba: No. I'm still at work.
2020/03/02, 17:29 - Lungelo: Ayt
2020/03/02, 18:26 - Lungelo: Mweb will call you tomorrow
2020/03/02, 18:26 - Lungelo: MetroFibre has activated on their side.
2020/03/02, 19:19 - Sechaba: Perfect. Thank you!
2020/03/02, 19:19 - Sechaba: Have you tried connecting again?
2020/03/02, 19:20 - Sechaba: Why is Mweb calling me?
2020/03/02, 19:21 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/03, 12:34 - Lungelo: Apparently the line was activated at 10h30 from their side?
2020/03/03, 12:59 - Sechaba: Yes. I've received an SMS. Did you call them?
2020/03/03, 13:01 - Lungelo: Yes. That's how I found this out.
2020/03/03, 13:02 - Lungelo: So last call needs to happen when one of us is at home with that information in the sms to activate the router
2020/03/03, 13:02 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/03, 16:55 - Lungelo: Please forward this

2020/03/05, 19:45 - Lungelo: Hi
2020/03/05, 19:45 - Lungelo: Could you please get my food at the door
2020/03/06, 08:02 - Sechaba: The first mweb debit order has gone off. It's 560/2.
2020/03/06, 13:05 - Lungelo: What's the full monthly premium and when in the month will the debit order go off?
2020/03/06, 13:20 - Sechaba: I'll confirm that later. But the first one was yesterday for 560.
2020/03/06, 13:29 - Lungelo: Ok

2020/03/08, 10:07 - Sechaba: I've left the car keys next to the LED light. I'll let you know if he does come through. Thanks for the help☝🏾
2020/03/09, 13:37 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/09, 13:40 - Sechaba: Yeah. That's fine. I think it's quite tight in there though.
2020/03/09, 14:05 - Lungelo: Cool
2020/03/13, 19:16 - Sechaba: Heads up. Coming back with some friends for a bit.
2020/03/13, 19:30 - Lungelo: What time, do you know?
2020/03/13, 20:07 - Lungelo: Hey man. I don't think I'll be joining tonight. Thanks for the offer 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
2020/03/16, 09:08 - Sechaba: Do you wana get something like this next month?

2020/03/19, 08:10 - Lungelo: Seems the wifi is back up
2020/03/19, 08:14 - Sechaba: Great!
2020/03/19, 08:14 - Sechaba: Metro might have fixed it after all?
2020/03/19, 08:15 - Lungelo: Probably. The lady was hesitant to help at first but she wanted to.
2020/03/20, 17:08 - Lungelo: What's the monthly premium for the internet
2020/03/20, 17:10 - Sechaba: 600
2020/03/20, 17:10 - Lungelo: You sure. No other amounts after that
2020/03/20, 17:32 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/03/20, 17:33 - Lungelo: Based on this calc, it's either I pay you R566 for all the debts incl internet and you must settle the R1453. 92 for water electricity and internet OR you pay me R287. 96 in order to settle just the water and electricity of R500.
2020/03/20, 17:34 - Lungelo: What also chows electricity is the geyser. Hence we have to top up regularly.
2020/03/20, 17:58 - Sechaba: Statement says 600.
2020/03/20, 17:58 - Lungelo: and agreement?
2020/03/20, 17:58 - Sechaba: I'll find out.
2020/03/20, 17:58 - Lungelo: it might just be for the month pro rata

2020/03/25, 14:54 - Lungelo: I don't know what's going on
2020/03/25, 14:58 - Lungelo: Also in light of the quarantine situation, we might need to buy a gas bottle in case this one runs dry.

2020/04/30, 17:26 - Sechaba: Nhla?
2020/04/30, 17:29 - Lungelo: She has
2020/04/30, 17:30 - Lungelo: The black one
2020/04/30, 17:30 - Lungelo: Not the white
2020/04/30, 17:30 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2020/04/30, 17:30 - Lungelo: How much is everything incl delivery

2020/05/29, 11:41 - Lungelo: I dont think it matters but no
2020/05/29, 11:44 - Sechaba: Haha this was meant to be a cheeky rhetorical question indicating that I'm happy for them to come over
2020/05/29, 14:12 - Lungelo: Oh 😅
2020/06/06, 11:56 - Sechaba: You deleted this message
2020/06/06, 12:00 - Sechaba: Nevermind
2020/06/06, 12:08 - Sechaba: We were running out of electricity so I loaded enough for about a week and then topped up the water account. Could you please top up the electricity some more when you get a chance.

2020/06/07, 22:49 - Lungelo: Hi. Are you sure you paid for the water.
2020/06/07, 22:49 - Lungelo: I see the R250 line there but it has no effect on the  "credit side" of the water account.
2020/06/07, 22:50 - Lungelo: Instead it's 2 R250 for electricity
2020/06/07, 22:51 - Lungelo: Well only R16 of that R250 went to water. The rest went to electricity.
2020/06/08, 09:18 - Sechaba: Yeah. I made two different payments and checked the box for the one.
2020/06/08, 09:18 - Lungelo: Didn't pull through. Go check
2020/06/13, 00:33 - Lungelo: Hey dude. Just letting you know I'm going to come back very late. 🙌🏾

2020/06/16, 22:03 - Sechaba: Cool. Thank you.

2020/06/17, 22:26 - Lungelo: Did you not get the payment yesterday? The notification?
2020/06/17, 22:27 - Lungelo: The invoice reflects
2020/06/17, 22:28 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/06/17, 22:29 - Lungelo: Please keep track and follow up tomorrow with the relevant people 🙌🏾
2020/06/17, 22:29 - Sechaba: Ok cool
2020/06/17, 22:30 - Sechaba: I'll follow up
2020/06/18, 08:25 - Sechaba: Do you have Jayson's number?
2020/06/18, 08:42 - Lungelo: No
2020/06/18, 08:42 - Lungelo: Sorry
2020/06/18, 19:08 - Sechaba: I made at least 6 calls throughout the day and I was told towards the end of the day that everything has been sorted. But we still don't have electricity. So I'm hoping we can get to noon with what we have and I'll call again in the morning.
2020/06/18, 19:11 - Lungelo: Who did you phone
2020/06/18, 19:11 - Lungelo: Send an email as well
2020/06/18, 19:11 - Lungelo: I ccd you to the address in the past
2020/06/19, 08:24 - Sechaba: The Protea people sent me an email this morning saying that they are busy sorting it out.
2020/06/19, 09:21 - Lungelo: Hi. Okay cool thanks. Please ask them what caused the problem and low key mention that it's unacceptable
2020/06/19, 14:30 - Sechaba: Still having issues. I'm communicating directly with the people that are meant to fix but nothing has happened.
2020/06/19, 14:30 - Sechaba: Do you have a plan B for tomorrow?
2020/06/19, 14:48 - Lungelo: I'll have to Uber to FirstRand
2020/06/19, 14:48 - Lungelo: Okay cool

2020/06/19, 18:08 - Sechaba: Thanks
2020/06/23, 11:41 - Sechaba: Water is not running. Apparently, it's affecting the entire complex.
2020/06/23, 11:53 - Lungelo: Hi. Okay thanks.
2020/07/02, 20:12 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. I've loaded more electricity. Could you please make sure the Excel sheet is up to date?
2020/07/02, 20:12 - Lungelo: I just bought for 500 as well
2020/07/02, 20:12 - Lungelo: Lol
2020/07/02, 20:14 - Sechaba: Ok cool. But then that should definitely last us the whole month.
2020/07/02, 20:14 - Sechaba: Ideally, I think we should try to get back to pre-April usage.
2020/07/02, 20:14 - Lungelo: We won't. It's winter. The geyser is working extra hard
2020/07/02, 20:14 - Lungelo: On its own
2020/07/02, 20:15 - Lungelo: And it's outside
2020/07/02, 20:15 - Lungelo: Plus we are working from home so laptops plugged in constantly also chow
2020/07/02, 20:16 - Lungelo: And more cooking, more everything.
2020/07/02, 20:17 - Lungelo: May is the ideal I think. More realistic. But I get you.
2020/07/02, 20:19 - Sechaba: We might need to consider switching off the geyser. The laptops and the cooking don't chow that much. We used like 5 units over those two days when we were on the brink.
2020/07/02, 20:21 - Lungelo: Sure. What do you propose? Switching off overnight or during the day
2020/07/02, 20:25 - Sechaba: Off during the day. Then it should always be warm in the mornings but then it doesn't during the day.
2020/07/13, 15:24 - Sechaba: What's her name?
2020/07/13, 15:27 - Lungelo: No name. Im taking lunchtime jogs now
2020/07/13, 15:28 - Lungelo: There's no one there
2020/07/13, 15:28 - Lungelo: At that time
2020/07/13, 15:33 - Sechaba: Alright. Enjoy then.
2020/07/13, 16:16 - Sechaba: Are we supposed to have load shedding now?
2020/07/13, 16:18 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/07/13, 16:19 - Sechaba: Oh cool. Thanks.
2020/07/16, 07:40 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. I looked at the house items spreadsheet and I was struggling to understand what's going on without looking carefully. I know you want to make sense from a credits and debits perspective, but is it fine we just have those 5 or 6 line items each month and whenever someone pays or is owed money, it's simply the negative of that amount. At the end of the month, the two negative amount need to balance.
2020/07/20, 16:26 - Lungelo: Please forward the pin
2020/07/20, 16:27 - Lungelo: NB

2020/07/21, 08:46 - Lungelo: That's what the call was for yesterday
2020/07/21, 08:48 - Sechaba: Did they say it's being resolved?
2020/07/21, 08:50 - Lungelo: I couldn't get through because I am not the account holder
2020/07/21, 08:50 - Lungelo: Hence the pin
2020/07/21, 09:15 - Sechaba: Couldn't get though to a technician. I'll try again in a few minutes.

2020/08/20, 17:49 - Lungelo: Hi there,

The message below is a message I received from a previous colleague during my time at Stellenbosch. May you please assist in completing the form for her?

Dear Lungelo

I am currently busy with a research project for my PhD-studies. The study is concerned with smartphone user behaviour. Part of the study entails the completion of an online survey by as many South African smartphone users as possible. Would you be so kind as to complete the survey and also forward the link to any friends or family members who would be willing to take part? The survey is only available in English.

The survey should take approximately 10-12 minutes to complete and may be completed using any electronic device (computer, tablet or smartphone). People who complete the survey before 4 September 2020 may enter a lucky draw and stand a chance to win one of three Takealot vouchers to the value to R500 each.

Use this link (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/STTBJPB) to complete the survey. 

Thank you for your time and the fowarding of the survey!

Kind regards
Rika

2020/09/25, 19:25 - Lungelo: Sorry my data was off
2020/09/25, 19:36 - Sechaba: 🙈🙈
2020/09/25, 19:36 - Sechaba: Cool. Do you need a lift?
2020/09/25, 19:40 - Lungelo: I'm going to try and catch the 20h30 Gautrain to Sandton because I land at like 20h00. So if I do catch it, it would be nice if you please got me at the Sandton Gautrain Station.
2020/09/25, 19:56 - Sechaba: 👌🏽
2020/09/25, 19:58 - Lungelo: I'll let you know when I board the train. If I miss it, I'll just Uber back.
2020/09/25, 20:05 - Sechaba: 👍🏽
2020/09/26, 20:16 - Lungelo: Hey man
2020/09/26, 20:16 - Lungelo: I'm in the Gautrain
2020/09/26, 20:16 - Lungelo: But don't worry about it
2020/09/26, 20:16 - Lungelo: I actually got a lift at the airport
2020/09/26, 20:17 - Lungelo: We are going to drive back together
2020/09/26, 20:17 - Lungelo: Thanks so much. I hope you hadn't left yet
2020/09/26, 20:41 - Sechaba: Hi. Cool cool. Do you have a lift from the station?
2020/10/06, 11:43 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Did you pick up a delivery?
2020/10/06, 11:45 - Sechaba: Oh cool. I see it's here. Sorry about that.
2020/10/06, 11:58 - Lungelo: 👍🏾
2020/10/10, 22:49 - Lungelo: https://www.netflorist.co.za/flowers/sympathy/price-asc/1/
2020/10/10, 22:50 - Lungelo: Hey. Please pick a set we should send through
2020/10/11, 08:52 - Sechaba: Hi. You'll probably have a better idea of what we should get, but I like these: https://www.netflorist.co.za/shop/flowers/sympathy/yellow-asiflorum-lily-bouquet/.
2020/10/11, 08:53 - Sechaba: Or pretty much any other set of lillies. But I'm happy for you to make the final decision.
2020/10/11, 13:01 - Lungelo: Small or medium?
2020/10/11, 18:27 - Sechaba: You can decide👍🏽
2020/10/11, 18:27 - Sechaba: I thought I had sent that message earlier🙈
2020/10/11, 18:27 - Sechaba: I'm sorry.
2020/10/12, 06:44 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Could you please top up the electricity when you get a chance.
2020/10/11, 23:33 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/10/11, 23:34 - Lungelo: I think I will go to the village and just put together a care package. The flowers can also be included (but like a bunch from Woolies or something). It's more value for money.
2020/10/11, 23:35 - Lungelo: Plus it's like a R20 Uber there so I'll just Uber the stuff to her place.
2020/10/11, 23:35 - Lungelo: R300 flowers will die after a week. And for what... What do you think?
2020/10/12, 07:37 - Sechaba: Yes. I'm happy with that.
2020/10/12, 08:23 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/10/12, 08:24 - Lungelo: For water
2020/10/12, 08:29 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/10/12, 08:37 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/10/12, 08:52 - Sechaba: What do you mean?
2020/10/12, 08:52 - Lungelo: I mean exactly that
2020/10/12, 08:53 - Lungelo: Your calc on the side
2020/10/12, 08:53 - Sechaba: I paid 1350 in September for the Internet, Electricity, and  Water.
2020/10/12, 08:56 - Lungelo: Lol okay I just refunded my share of the internet bill. Not sure about the R750 electricity. Which part of September did you buy it in? Which day ? I'm willing to pay my share from the 27th to now.
2020/10/12, 08:58 - Sechaba: Yeah. I think we can pro rata the electricity and water. What do you mean you refunded the internet bill?
2020/10/12, 08:58 - Lungelo: If you check the bill you only paid R58 for water
2020/10/12, 08:59 - Lungelo: In September. Which was when I wasn't here. I paid for the water before I left.
2020/10/12, 08:59 - Lungelo: Check the spreadsheet. Just settled water of R248 and electricity of R500.
2020/10/12, 09:02 - Sechaba: That's strange. The 250 was debited from my account and the line description says something about the 250. Do you know why this might be?
2020/10/12, 09:03 - Lungelo: No idea. I just eft.
2020/10/12, 09:04 - Sechaba: Cool. Thank you.
2020/10/13, 21:59 - Lungelo: Hi. Do you know of any reliable watchmakers?
2020/10/13, 21:59 - Lungelo: In the area
2020/10/14, 06:47 - Sechaba: Hi. No, I don't. Sorry.
2020/10/15, 21:31 - Lungelo: 🥺🥺🥺thank you very much for the package you guys had me in tears it’s highly appreciated ♥️♥️ please thank Sechaba as well
2020/10/15, 21:41 - Sechaba: 🙌🏾🙌🏾
2020/10/16, 18:30 - Lungelo: Eden Sandton: Temporary exit pin is 19972. Valid for 1 tries.
2020/10/20, 19:21 - Sechaba: Hi. I realised I didn't close off my calcs for September. When you said you refunded your part of the internet bill, did you mean you paid it over?
2020/10/20, 19:22 - Lungelo: No
I paid it through settling the water and buying R500 electricity
2020/10/20, 19:23 - Lungelo: Which was about R750
2020/10/20, 19:24 - Sechaba: Ok cool.
2020/10/20, 19:26 - Sechaba: Internet is up to 650 starting October btw.
2020/10/20, 19:39 - Lungelo: I saw.
2020/10/20, 19:40 - Lungelo: The problem was that things were paid for in September without a recon being done in full.
2020/10/20, 19:43 - Lungelo: So it's a bit of a mess to determine what's what, especially since I wasn't here the whole of September effectively
2020/10/20, 21:31 - Sechaba: Yeah. We'll just have to recon better next time.
2020/10/22, 17:48 - Lungelo: Is there a way of speaking to Mweb because the internet is extremely bad
2020/10/22, 17:48 - Lungelo: I can't even load Instagram which doesn't need that much speed
2020/10/22, 18:17 - Sechaba: Hi. I think we'd need to call them like normal.
2020/10/22, 18:17 - Sechaba: My side has been okay though.
2020/11/05, 08:54 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Do you mind if I grab a scone?
2020/11/05, 08:55 - Lungelo: Hi sure you can have as many as you want
2020/11/05, 08:55 - Lungelo: Slightly over baked though 😭
2020/11/05, 08:56 - Sechaba: Cool. Thanks:)
2020/11/05, 08:58 - Sechaba: I'm happy
2020/11/05, 10:39 - Lungelo: 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
2020/11/09, 13:51 - Lungelo: Hi. Please send me your evidence for rental PMT for April and August. Not sure what this Natasha girlie is talking about 🙄 Eden is the ghetto.
2020/11/09, 14:04 - Sechaba: Hi. I've sent it on email.
2020/11/09, 14:38 - Lungelo: 👍🏾

2020/11/11, 20:16 - Sechaba: Sure
2020/11/13, 08:10 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Do you mind topping up the electricity?
2020/11/17, 12:21 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2020/11/17, 12:44 - Lungelo: LMAO where are you even getting this from 😂😂😂😂
2020/11/17, 13:11 - Sechaba: Hahaha I never deleted it. Google decided to remind me.

2020/11/22, 10:15 - Sechaba: Got it
2020/11/22, 11:00 - Lungelo: Thanks so much
2020/11/24, 08:06 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Are they supposed to pay us the interest on our deposit now or only when we move out?
2020/11/24, 08:07 - Lungelo: Hi 👋🏽Not sure. People do it differently. I think now...
2020/11/24, 08:10 - Sechaba: Cool
2020/11/24, 08:11 - Lungelo: I don't think it will be much. Probably like R600
2020/11/24, 08:20 - Sechaba: Speak for yourself. 600 is a lot to me
2020/11/28, 12:56 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>

2020/12/03, 16:40 - Lungelo: I did it 🤭
2020/12/03, 16:41 - Lungelo: I just closed my eyes.
2020/12/03, 16:41 - Lungelo: Not sure when they will arrive.
2020/12/03, 17:12 - Sechaba: 😱😱
2020/12/03, 17:13 - Lungelo: What
2020/12/03, 17:14 - Sechaba: I'm just surprised.
2020/12/03, 17:14 - Sechaba: The couches are really nice👌🏾
2020/12/05, 09:43 - Lungelo: Hey do you have R50 cash with you by any chance
2020/12/05, 09:44 - Lungelo: The couch people are on their way and the delivery was R50 short when I made the TF
2020/12/05, 09:52 - Sechaba: I do. Yes.
2020/12/05, 09:54 - Lungelo: Please spare one for me / the drivers

2020/12/07, 10:38 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Do you mind switching off connections on your side for a bit. Going through my performance review and connection is struggling.
2020/12/07, 10:39 - Lungelo: Hey. I'm not on the WiFi

2020/12/18, 23:50 - Lungelo: Hi. What do you mean R200 paid over
2020/12/18, 23:52 - Lungelo: The water bill is only R100. But I'll pay R200
2020/12/18, 23:58 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/12/19, 07:31 - Sechaba: Hi. The 200 is to balance the Nov pmts. The difference between what you've paid and what I've paid.
2020/12/19, 07:47 - Lungelo: Okay I'll have a look
2020/12/20, 12:25 - Sechaba: Home safe?

2020/12/22, 09:21 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/12/22, 09:23 - Lungelo: We're both meant to incur, based on the updated calculations, R872. 5. Based on what you've paid, you're out of pocket by R28. I'll also add the R55 from last month and the R50 couch delivery cash I owe you. So R133
2020/12/22, 09:27 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2020/12/22, 12:14 - Sechaba: Ah. I forgot about the gift + October balance.
2020/12/22, 12:14 - Sechaba: <Media omitted>
2020/12/22, 12:21 - Lungelo: What's misc
2020/12/22, 12:22 - Lungelo: Ay I don't know
2020/12/22, 12:22 - Sechaba: The delivery
2020/12/22, 12:22 - Lungelo: Just add up everything in total except the R50 for delivery
2020/12/22, 12:23 - Lungelo: Yeah it's fine.
2020/12/22, 12:23 - Lungelo: All sorted now
2021/01/01, 00:20 - Sechaba: Happy New Year Lungelo!✨ I wanted to thank you for being a great friend and flat mate in 2020. I look forward to what will hopefully be a less leaky and less noisy 2021.

No idea... Haven't decided yet... Why what's up
2021/01/02, 15:09 - Sechaba: Cool. No worries.
2021/01/02, 15:09 - Sechaba: I'll just need to top up the electricity soon and I wanted to avoid the situation that happened last time.
2021/01/19, 16:25 - Sechaba: How's the driving practice going?
2021/01/19, 18:11 - Lungelo: What driving practice 😩

2021/01/20, 18:32 - Sechaba: Just take your laptop with.
2021/01/20, 18:38 - Lungelo: What are you talking about 😂
2021/01/20, 18:39 - Lungelo: I'm not going to go for driving lessons
2021/01/20, 18:39 - Lungelo: Not yet
2021/01/20, 18:54 - Sechaba: I thought you were going to practise with your mom
2021/01/20, 19:10 - Lungelo: Lmao where did you get that impression 😂😂😂
2021/01/21, 15:29 - Sechaba: I'm just throwing out suggestions😉

A friend of mine is coming to Sandton with a few things of mine and I was wondering if you'll be at the flat today and if it's fine if I give them your number so they can let you know when they are en route?

2021/02/18, 08:21 - Sechaba: Hi. Did you drop your mask on your way out?
2021/02/18, 08:38 - Lungelo: I did yes
2021/02/18, 08:38 - Lungelo: Lol
2021/02/18, 08:38 - Lungelo: But I have another one on so don't stress
2021/02/18, 08:48 - Sechaba: I just wanted to make I haven't picked up some stranger's mask😐
2021/02/18, 08:49 - Lungelo: You won't die
2021/02/18, 08:49 - Lungelo: And I hadn't used it
2021/02/18, 08:49 - Lungelo: Where did you get it

2021/05/01, 23:21 - Lungelo: Hey Sechaba are you awake
2021/05/01, 23:24 - Lungelo: Is it fine if Kofi sleeps over tonight. He's had too much to drink and won't make it back to Pretoria

2021/05/26, 22:38 - Lungelo: Hey Sechaba 👋🏾 seems like the gas is out 🤧🤧🤧
2021/05/27, 08:21 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Cool. I'll buy a new one when I get a chance.
2021/05/27, 10:54 - Lungelo: Thank you.
2021/05/29, 11:09 - Lungelo: Hi Sechaba... Just wanted to let you know that I have been sick the past week with similar symptoms that Beaurel had... Started on Monday for me and has been up and down ever since... I'm going to go to the doctor if it does not improve by Monday and will also test for COVID.
2021/05/31, 14:11 - Sechaba: Hi. Are you feeling better?
2021/05/31, 14:14 - Lungelo: Hey 👋🏾
I am doing fine. Not significantly better than yesterday but good. Can still do things. Smell and taste gone though since Saturday. Hope it comes back 😭😭😭
2021/05/31, 14:16 - Sechaba: You not going to test?
2021/05/31, 14:26 - Lungelo: Lol it's the VID child. Day 8 of isolation. Taste and smell won't come back until much later (up to months for some people) ... It's normal.
2021/05/31, 14:27 - Lungelo: But if it will make you feel better I can go
2021/05/31, 14:31 - Sechaba: I was just wondering if you wanted to make it official
2021/06/01, 09:56 - Lungelo: Morning. How much was the gas refill
2021/06/01, 09:58 - Sechaba: Morning. I've added it to the house items spreadsheet.
2021/06/01, 10:02 - Lungelo: Thanks
2021/06/01, 10:15 - Sechaba: 🙌🏾
2021/06/01, 10:15 - Sechaba: Do you mind topping up the water and electricity?
2021/06/01, 10:16 - Lungelo: Already paid for the water
2021/06/01, 10:16 - Lungelo: Electricity will form part of the June recon
2021/06/02, 11:10 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Did you end up topping up the electricity?
2021/06/02, 11:51 - Lungelo: No
2021/06/02, 11:51 - Lungelo: I'll do it later
2021/06/02, 12:41 - Lungelo: So I've been booked off for the rest of the week.
2021/06/02, 12:41 - Lungelo: Thr doctors said its pointless to test because Lehloa tested positive so it's probably Covid too. And because I am already Day 10 into isolation/ Day 8 from symptom day.
2021/06/02, 12:41 - Lungelo: They're sending extra medication to take and said that the remaining symptoms last up to a few weeks after the Day 10 so I shouldn't worry too much.
2021/06/02, 12:54 - Sechaba: Cool cool
2021/06/03, 12:24 - Lungelo: Thank you for getting my order. Appreciate it
2021/06/03, 12:34 - Sechaba: 👍🏾
2021/06/04, 10:27 - Sechaba: You feeling better?
2021/06/04, 11:39 - Lungelo: Morning Sechaba. I'm feeling better thank you. Just the cough that's left but the doctor said it wi remain for a while. Today is Day 10 from symptoms and Day 12 from exposure so I shouldn't be contagious anymore.

2021/06/09, 13:30 - Sechaba: Hi. The fridge is off.
2021/06/09, 13:32 - Lungelo: Did you put it off or is it broken?
2021/06/09, 13:38 - Sechaba: Broken, possibly
2021/06/09, 13:40 - Sechaba: I checked the plug and that's fine.
2021/06/09, 14:43 - Lungelo: I've logged a call with KIC. The technician is coming within 24 to 48 working hours.
2021/06/09, 14:43 - Lungelo: I don't know when that is. If you have perishables please either cook them tonight or keep them at Ntobe's place or something

2021/06/15, 11:41 - Lungelo: Thank you

2021/06/15, 15:00 - Lungelo: Did he mention when they're bringing the new one?
2021/06/15, 15:11 - Sechaba: No, he did not. I don't he is involved, he just gives the diagnosis.

2021/06/18, 09:55 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Have you heard anything about the fridge?
2021/06/18, 09:55 - Lungelo: Hi. Literally nothing.
2021/06/18, 09:56 - Lungelo: I'll have to call the people
2021/06/18, 10:00 - Lungelo: Makro is processing the replacement
2021/06/18, 10:13 - Sechaba: Thank you!🙌🏾
2021/06/20, 09:28 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2021/06/20, 11:01 - Sechaba: 🙌🏾
2021/06/21, 12:04 - Lungelo: They are picking up the fridge this week but I am getting a refund not another fridge. So I still need to find another one.
2021/06/21, 12:05 - Lungelo: Hi 👋🏾
2021/06/21, 12:29 - Sechaba: Hi. Ok😔
2021/06/22, 16:24 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. They're collecting the fridge🙌🏾
2021/06/22, 16:57 - Sechaba: Also, I think your viennas are going off.
2021/06/22, 16:59 - Lungelo: Lol please throw everything out
2021/06/22, 17:00 - Lungelo: Thank you
2021/06/22, 17:00 - Lungelo: Did they fetch it?
2021/06/22, 18:22 - Sechaba: Yes. All gone.
2021/06/26, 10:29 - Sechaba: Please tell me we're getting a new fridge soon😭
2021/06/26, 10:58 - Lungelo: Unfortunately Makro has not refunded the cost of the previous fridge and the replacement of a similar one is R6k at the minimum. I don't have that kind of money at the moment. Sorry man.
2021/06/26, 10:58 - Lungelo: How have you been coping without the fridge so far?
2021/06/26, 11:19 - Sechaba: 😔 Rice and beans🙈
2021/06/26, 11:28 - Lungelo: <Media omitted>
2021/06/26, 11:28 - Lungelo: Sounds sad
2021/06/26, 11:31 - Sechaba: It was initially fast food then it got expensive and now I've been trying to reverse the damage🙈
2021/06/26, 11:31 - Sechaba: Where is this?
2021/06/26, 11:31 - Lungelo: Markham
2021/06/26, 11:31 - Lungelo: Online and in store
2021/06/26, 11:31 - Lungelo: I see. Sorry man
2021/06/26, 11:32 - Sechaba: Cool. Thank you🙌🏾
2021/06/27, 15:01 - Sechaba: Btw, I might have started a YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/HLemQuaqZHY
2021/06/27, 15:01 - Sechaba: Forewarning for all the times you'll hear me 'talking to myself'.

2021/07/05, 09:30 - Your security code with Lungelo changed. Tap to learn more.
2021/07/07, 08:45 - Sechaba: Hi Lungelo. Do you have an update on the fridge situation?
2021/07/07, 08:46 - Lungelo: Hey Sechaba how are you? 

They paid back the refund of R3.5 but as I mentioned before, I don't have the 2.5 required to replace the fridge at the moment.
2021/07/07, 08:48 - Sechaba: Sorry. I'm alright thanks, how are you?
2021/07/07, 08:49 - Sechaba: Oh I didn't understand that part. I thought the refund is equivalent to the price of a new fridge.
2021/07/07, 11:21 - Lungelo: I'm okay thank you
2021/07/07, 11:21 - Lungelo: Yeah no...
I bought it on Black Friday so they gave me back what I paid for.
2021/07/07, 13:19 - Sechaba: This seems unfair given they didn't offer to replace it, but okay. Thanks.
2021/07/12, 16:20 - Lungelo: Hey man how's it going?

Was just wondering - for purposes of balancing out the spreadsheet would it not be a better option for you to get the replacement fridge?
2021/07/12, 16:49 - Sechaba: Hey Lungelo:) Good, thanks. How are you?

Yeah, makes sense. I think the prices might skyrocket soon🙈
2021/07/12, 16:52 - Sechaba: What was the other one called so I can avoid it?
2021/07/12, 21:22 - Lungelo: KIC
2021/07/12, 21:22 - Lungelo: But the size is 312L. So anything from 312L and above is a good size
2021/07/12, 21:22 - Lungelo: 😓🥲Bad timing
2021/07/16, 17:44 - Sechaba: How have things been?
2021/07/17, 12:13 - Lungelo: Hey how are you?
2021/07/17, 12:14 - Lungelo: It's been okay thanks. Tough times in Zululand
2021/07/17, 15:02 - Sechaba: I had to go to the doctor this week, but I'm okay.
2021/07/17, 15:03 - Sechaba: Yeah. Has it been bad on your side of town?
2021/07/17, 15:58 - Lungelo: Why'd you have to go to the doctor?
2021/07/17, 15:58 - Lungelo: Yed
2021/07/17, 15:58 - Lungelo: Yes
2021/07/17, 15:58 - Lungelo: But it's slowly reopening
2021/07/17, 16:46 - Sechaba: Glad to hear that🙌🏾
2021/07/17, 16:46 - Sechaba: I was having chest pains, but the doctor says it's not serious.
2021/07/24, 22:09 - Lungelo: Nhla's dad passed away earlier today
2021/07/26, 12:56 - Sechaba: That's terrible. I hope she's okay. 

My mom was hospitalised with Covid this weekend.
2021/07/26, 14:20 - Lungelo: She's not... But yeah.

The fatigue and stuff stay on quite long. Is she taking supplements?

2021/08/04, 09:55 - Lungelo: 1000mg vitamin C
