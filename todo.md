- automate the extraction of the whatsapp chats - Whatsapp API?
- consider switching from sqllite and working with a dbms that allows data to be transferred to the cloud
- create a meaningful primary key between contacts + whatsapp data
- landing/staging area vs data lake vs data warehouse
- log table for ETL jobs (check out dbt)
- use Faker library + bamboolib (pandas UI)
- create branch + practise pull requests + issues

* who said what game - snippets from the whatsapp chats and you can guess who said what
* automatic web search, aggregation, and visualisattion of the things topical between you and a friend

# get sense of friend's mood from whatsapp chats using nlp and link that with a list of songs from Spotify (need to figure out way to get details about songs that can be linked to sentiment). but build up better profile to give more general recommendations
