## Brief

Building a personal database to store the contacts details of my friends and any other interesting information about them. The goal is to build a database will eventually contain cell numbers, social media handles, Whatsapp chats, and network diagrams showing mutual friends and common conversation topics.

The project will use the pandas, numpy, regex, and sqlite libraries amongst others.

### To do:

#### 1. Link contacts to Whatsapp chats + create easily searchable database

#### 2. Apply natural language processing to get a sense of the conversations
